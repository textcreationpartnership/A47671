            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Will not trouble my ſelf, kind Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to make a Buſtle for your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, in favour of my Book: It will ſpeak for it ſelf; and if the Reaſons which it offers are not of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Force, 'twould be in vain for me to alledge mine. Excuſe me therefore, for producing any more then only this, That there is great Reaſon the World ſhould know, what a Saint the King of <hi>France</hi> has got to teach him the Way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63944:3"/>However, I cannot forbear to tell you, That you ought, in ſome meaſure, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn me Thanks for the Preſent that I make you; not ſo much for the value of it, as for the danger to which I expoſe my ſelf for your ſake. I attack not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt revengeful Man that ever the Sun ſhone upon, but a whole Society, that never pardons any Injury, and from whoſe remorſeleſs Hatred there is no <hi>Aſylum</hi> can ſecure me. For ſuppoſe that I had drawn upon me the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my native Sovereign the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſhould retire to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> under the declar'd Protection of King <hi>William,</hi> which one would think were ſufficient to guard me from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces of the moſt puiſſant Monarch in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet early or late, this caba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ling Society would find a way to ſacrifice me to the Reſentment of my offended Prince: Nor ſhould I be the firſt who had fallen into their Snares. Have they not whirlwinded ſeveral out of
<pb facs="tcp:63944:3"/>
               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> that at this very Day lie Rotting in the Dungeons of Mount St. <hi>Michel?</hi> Others have been aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the very Court of <hi>Hanouer.</hi> And the ſame Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> that illuſtrious Impoſtor, againſt whom I write, did he not enforce the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſes</hi> to deliver into his hands an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Perſon that had written ſomething againſt him, tho' he had not made out any thing that was very Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and was extreamly miſtaken in ſome of his Conjectures. What would become of me then, ſhould he come to diſcover who I am, and who I may be. Nothing could ſave me from his Fury. But as good Luck would have it, tho' I have had the Opportunity to know him <hi>Intus &amp; in cute,</hi> yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he has no reaſon to be more ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of me then another. He ſees, and is ſeen by ſo many People of all Sorts, and Conditions, of which the greateſt Number curſe his Infidelities, and Treacheries, experienc'd by them
<pb facs="tcp:63944:4"/>
ſelves, that his Suſpitions would be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt in the Throng. Beſides, it may be well imagin'd, that 'twas not from himſelf that I learnt the following Particulars of his Life. He is not a Man to truſt every body with his Secrets. Yet in regard no man can be Vicious alone, and that there muſt be the paſſive, as well as the active Part, in all manner of Luxury, 'tis no leſs certain that Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> muſt all a-long have had his Intimates, and <hi>Socios Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum,</hi> among whom it was impoſſible for Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> to chooſe ſo well, but that there might be now and then a <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never ask me then through what Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel theſe Curoſities were convey'd to my Knowledge. For 'tis a Queſtion to which it becomes me not to give a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anſwer, and that upon good grounds. All that I can ſay to it is this, That I was none of thoſe who had the feweſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegues with the Society for ſeveral Years
<pb facs="tcp:63944:4"/>
together; beſides that I had ſundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends who were perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Jeſuit, from the time that he was firſt admitted into the Order, by whoſe means I had the Opportunity, not only to hear ſeveral Stories confirm'd by Tradition, but alſo in Private, and as it were by Stealth, to read his <hi>Memoirs</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now in regard the following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comprehends as well the Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Gallantries of his Youth, as the ungodly Practices, the Treacheries and Villanies of his riper Years, and more crafty Age, As to the Firſt, there's no body can have any reaſon to deny, but that Tradition might be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithful Aſſiſtant to me. For there is no cauſe to believe him more a Saint when he was a young Man, then now he is the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Confeſſor. The Fox has only chang'd his Skin, but not his Conditions. And I ſhould take him to be very incredulous, that ſhould give
<pb facs="tcp:63944:5"/>
Credit to the Frailties of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Youth, and yet ſcruple to believe the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s. As for the deep Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of his riper Years, and the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Effects of his more mature Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there needs no more then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of Two Popes, the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Camus,</hi> and others, to convince yee of a great deal, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that all his Actions, of which they complain, are no other then what is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natual and conſonant to the Humour, the Genius, and Morals of that Society, of which he is the Head, and Directour; and for many of the reſt, the dire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Penitent, the French Monarch, ſo much guided by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, are ſuch Evidences to the World, of his being the Man I mean, that no one can well queſtion the truth of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I cannot expect that this poor Book of mine, ſhould be approv'd of in all places; for how is it poſſible
<pb facs="tcp:63944:5"/>
it ſhould be ſo? for I can neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, nor betray my Sentiments. I utter things ſincerely as I think; and this is not the Mode at this time: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be read, and that is all that I deſire. However, ſhould it ne'er be lookt upon, this would be my Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that I make no trade of writing; and if I have laſh'd out a little, 'twas meerly the Inſtigation of my Zeal for the Publick, which I could not ſuffer to be ſo long impos'd upon, while the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor triumph'd without ſome kind of Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Reader, If you ſtand too nice upon the Punctilioes of a Hiſtory, mine will not pleaſe yee. I know, that to preſent a Hiſtory dreſt up in form, 'tis requiſite the Author ſhould tye himſelf ſolely to his ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:63944:6"/>
I have given my ſelf a great Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For in regard the Perſon, whoſe Actions I trace, is a kind of an <hi>Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitarian,</hi> here and there, and every where, I was forc'd to follow him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Projects lead me, and as he chang'd his Scenes to vary mine: which caus'd a Diviſion of the <hi>Continuum,</hi> that could not be avoided.</p>

            <p>I knew, Reader, the Subject would pleaſe you, and therefore printed the Book, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Gentleman according to his Directions.

And doubtleſs, this was the Opinion of thoſe who prohibited, under very ſevere Penalties, the very naming the Name of that famous Villain, who in One Day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the moſt magnificent Temple in the World, which had been rearing ſo many Years. And the ſame Thought might have hinder'd me from publiſhing this Piece, had I not been induc'd by quite contrary Reaſons which are of great weight. I conſider'd, That among all the Diſorders ſo rife in the World, there is none more offenſive then Outward-Shew, which confounds Hypocrites with ſincere and honeſt People; and which is ſuch, that without a long and very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Obſervation, 'tis impoſſible, oft-times, to diſtinguiſh the one from the other: ſo that a Man is forc'd to pay the ſame Honour and Reſpect to Impoſture, as to Real Truth. 'Tis a Miſchief ſo general, and ſo inevitable, that I do not believe there is any Perſon in the World who has not ſeveral times been deluded by it. But

after that, when he comes to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, there cannot be a greater Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Man, then to have been the Cully of a Villain who ſports, unpuniſh'd, with Heav'n and all Mankind.</p>
            <p>I therefore thought it would be no ſmall piece of good Service done the Publick, to make an open Diſcovery of thoſe that have been lately found out for ſuch. And this is the only Motive that induc'd me to ſet Pen to Paper.</p>
            <p>All the Jeſuites in general may be ſaid to be of this number. Their wicked Morals, and the horrid Crimes which have been the Productions of thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, are convincing Proofs of what I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. But among all the whole Gang, of neceſſity it muſt be agreed, That Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> at this day the King's Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, is one that challenges to be rank'd among the Topping Hypocrites, as being a <hi>Tartuff</hi> in a ſoveraign degree, and one that has found the way to impoſe, for ſo many Years together, upon one of the moſt quick-ſighted and penetrating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the World: for to think that he willingly ſhuts his Eyes, in Conſideration of the Uſefulneſs of his Counſels, and the Services done him by the Society through his means, is never to be imagin'd. There
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63944:9"/>
are a thouſand ſubſtantial Reaſons againſt it: and not to inſiſt upon Reports, I ſhall ſay no more, then that our Monarch is a Prince that loves Vertue, and hates Vice where-ever he meets it; that is to ſay, with reference to the general Converſe of Men, and gaining to himſelf an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Applauſe; and therefore it is not probable, that if he knew it, he would tolerate down-right Knavery in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
            <p>I do not therefore believe I ſhall draw the King's Indignation upon me, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking this Hypocrite, as I am about to do in this Hiſtory. To which purpoſe I cannot begin better, then with giving the Reader an Exact Portraiture of the Perſon who is to be the Subject of my Diſcourſe. By which means I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for every thing which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he is to expect, ſo that he will be the leſs ſurpriz'd when he ſhall ſee ſo many things that ſo little correſpond with his Character.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> is Middle-ſiz'd, Slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough, and who now goes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Stooping. His Noſe Compact, but Large, and ſomewhat like a Hawk's Beak. His Complexion Freſh and Ruddy, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63944:9"/>
Marks of a Healthy Conſtitution: His Mouth a little too much apt to gape and ſhew his Teeth, which are none of the handſomeſt, though ſound enough: His Eyes, which are the moſt agreeable part of his Face, are Blew, and well enchas'd. They are uſually call'd the Mirrors of the Soul: but certainly they are not ſo in him; unleſs you'll ſay, That ſhe never ſhews any more then one Side there, which is Flattery and Complacency. We muſt confeſs, he does with his Eyes what he he pleaſes; but uſually he will have 'em to be Milde, Engaging, and full of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Nor is he leſs skilful to compoſe his Meen and Garb, then his Looks. You would ſwear, did you but ſee his modeſt Air, and his affable Behaviour, that he were the beſt Natur'd, the moſt Down-right Perſon, and moſt eaſily wrought upon in the World. To Great Perſonages he is Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, creeps and cringes; and nothing drops from his Lips but Proteſtations of Fidelity, Services, and a moſt entire and abſolute Devotion. And as for Ordinary Perſons, he hears 'em patiently and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to the end; and then always gives 'em good Words, and amuſes 'em with Hopes. This is perfectly to be obſerv'd in the Audiences that he gives upon <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63944:10"/>
and <hi>Fridays.</hi> Upon thoſe Days you ſhall always find above Two hundred People in his Anti-Chamber, of all Ranks and Conditions, Citizens, Learned Men, Lawyers; and among them, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Diminutive Bands, whoſe Eyes are never off from the Door, and who never hear it open, but they ſee two or three Benefices coming out. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he hears all theſe People, without ſhewing the leaſt Diſturbance, and has the knack to pleaſe 'em all with ſweet Sugar-Plumb Words. His Habit very well agrees with his Outward Shew of Humility; the Stuff is little different from what the reſt of the Society makes uſe of; and he wears his Gown Two Years, like the Meaneſt among the Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, theſe petty Mortifications are amply allay'd and ſoften'd by the Pleaſure which he has to ſee Princes, Dukes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, and in a word, all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Higheſt Rank and Quality, come to kiſs the Hemm of his Garment, and beg his Protection.</p>
            <p>Thus much in general for his Out-ſide. But his In-ſide is quite another thing: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World more cloſe and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; ſo that unleſs you are extremely Familiar with him, 'tis a hard matter to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63944:10"/>
Know him. The foul Concealments of his Breaſt are impenetrable: He is Knave and Wicked beyond Imagination; does Good to Few, Miſchief to Thouſands; unleſs it be to the Eccleſiaſticks, to whom he is oblig'd to diſtribute Benifices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that otherwiſe they would lye va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. But the Man is unborn for whom he did a Kindneſs of his own Inclination; or if ever he does one, be confident, 'tis out of ſome Proſpect of Intereſt. There are two ſorts of Perſons with whom he is never to be reconcil'd; Honeſt Men, and thoſe that are in Favour. The Firſt, becauſe he in nothing reſembles 'em; the Second, by reaſon he is jealous of 'em, and for that he would fain poſſeſs the Prince's Ear alone by himſelf. He loves his Pleaſures and his Eaſe more then any Courtier; and his Inclination leads him to Luxury and Expence. But in regard he knows this would not be the ſhorteſt way to maintain himſelf in the Credit to which he has attain'd, he keeps himſelf within Bounds as much as he can. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he cannot forbear allowing himſelf a Lacquey, and a very neat Coach, with Four the beſt Horſes in <hi>Paris.</hi> As for his Table, he finds it always ſpread in the King's Palace; and when he returns to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63944:11"/>
the Houſe of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> he fares ne'er a whit the worſe for that. But 'tis not there that he makes his moſt delicate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſts; for they that would know how this bleſſed Father governs himſelf, muſt go to the fine Houſe which he has built at the end of the <hi>Faubourg St. Anthony,</hi> which affords a moſt delightful Proſpect to thoſe that walk upon the Bulwark. That's the Place where all the ſumptuous Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Merry-Meetings are appointed; but they muſt be his intimate Friends that are invited thither. Many Courtly Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures happen there, which I ſhall not recite in this place, becauſe there are ſeveral Particulars of which I am yet ignorant, and which I ſhall take care to inform my ſelf of more at large; and if I find that this little Manual meets with a favourable Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall impart my further Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge another time.</p>
            <p>Whatever Liberty he allows himſelf in that Place, when he returns from thence, he reſumes his Air and Meen of Devotion without the leaſt Trouble in the World. For my part, I cannot apprehend how he is able to ſtrain his Diſſimulation ſo high; but you may give a Gueſs by this little Draught. One day that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tyr'd with an Audience of above
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63944:11"/>
Five Hours, and that he was already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to repoſe himſelf in his Cabinet, Fryer <hi>Benedict</hi> came to tell him, That the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers,</hi> who was return'd from his Province, deſir'd to kiſs his Hand. <hi>What would that</hi> Janſeniſt <hi>have with me?</hi> (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> in a great Paſſion,) <hi>I am ſo plagu'd with his Viſits: Why does he not keep at home? I'll aſſure him, I'll never run after him—But 'tis my misfortune to be thus perpetually beſieg'd by ſuch kind of Perſons.</hi> So ſaying, away he flung out of his Cabinet; and returning to the Biſhop, ſo ſoon as he perceiv'd him, with open Arms, and with a Countenance wherein Joy and Satisfaction were ſerenely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Oh, Sir!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>what an Obligation have you laid upon me, to prevent me with ſo much Goodneſs! What a Contentment to my Soul is this Viſit of yours! Truly, ſeeing I have not had the Honour to ſee you a long time, I have been labouring under moſt cruel diſquiet to know what place I poſſeſs in your Heart — I beſeech yee, Sir, let me know, Have I the leaſt ſhare of your Affection? — Do me the Favour to liſt me in the number of your moſt Humble Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Tone he continu'd his Famila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity all the time of the Viſit, with ſuch an Outward Shew of Sincerity, that I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63944:12"/>
knew not whether I was aſleep or awake: for you muſt know, that this Prelate was Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> his mortal Enemy's own Brother.</p>
            <p>Having given this Portraiture of this Religious Saint. I ſhould think it Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to add any thing farther; and I am alſo apt to believe, that a Man cannot well know more. I proceed therefore to the Relation.</p>
            <p>Were it my Intention rather to Pleaſe my Reader, then to ſpeak Truth, I ſhould follow the Example of a great number of Authors, who would think it a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt the Laws of Hiſtory, ſhould they write the Life of any Perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſcribing to him ſome extraordinary Birth, or ſignaliz'd by ſome ſurpriſing Events, which in truth very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs and awaken the Attention; but in regard it is not my Deſign to frame a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, I ſhall only relate things nakedly as they are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> was born at <hi>Lion,</hi> and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from a Family that made ſome Figure among the Burgeſſes. His Father alſo had ſerv'd ſome time in the Wars; had ſeen the World, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63944:12"/>
the Manners of it; ſo that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only an Eſtate to write Gentleman, as he had a great deſire to do. He had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children, and among the reſt, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here mention'd; who putting forth early Bloſſoms of a pregnant Wit, and giving great Hopes, was ſent to School; where he made great Progreſſes in a ſhort time, though he were very debauch'd, which is a way of living that does not well agree with ſtudious Application. He perform'd his Philoſophical Exerciſes under Father <hi>de Vaux,</hi> who was afterwards advanc'd to the Higheſt Employments in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and to him it was that he owes all his Fortune, in regard that Father protected and ſupported him with his Credit upon all Occaſions; and while he liv'd, their Intereſts were inſeparable.</p>
            <p>Some good honeſt ſimple Soul may imagine, perhaps, that the Foundation of ſo firm a Friendſhip was nothing elſe but Neighbourly Love and Charity. 'Tis true, that Neighbourly Love had a great ſhare in it; but it was not that Love of our Neighbour which is recommended to us in Scripture.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">In the Year </seg>1644</label> Our Scholar, who kept a Daughter of Joy, having promis'd one of his Friends that liv'd at <hi>Maſcon</hi> to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63944:13"/>
bring her to his Houſe, during the Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Vintage-time, ſet forth from <hi>Lion</hi> along with his Love; but Night over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking 'em, they were conſtrain'd to lie in a Village, where there was but one poor Inn. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> call'd for a Chamber, and order'd Supper and a Bed to be got ready for his Wife and himſelf, and then went out to take a walk. He was not gone far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a certain Knight came to the ſame inn and deſir'd a Lodging alſo. The Inn-keeper told him, he had but one Chamber, which a Gentleman and his Wife had already beſpoke; but that he could make him another Bed in the ſame Chamber, if he pleas'd to lie there. The Knight, who had ſome particular Reaſons to be ſhie of Company, was a little ſcrupulous at firſt; but in regard he had a great way to the next Village, he reſolv'd to ſtay. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he alighted, and after he had ſet up his Horſe in the Stable, went up ſtairs to the pretended Wife of the pretended Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to whom he made very great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and a thouſand Excuſes upon the Inconveniences to which he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to put ſo charming a Lady, and for whom he felt the ſudden Motions of ſo high a Reſpect. The Lady, who was not accuſtom'd to ſuch Sublimities and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63944:13"/>
Raptures of Language, was almoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranc'd to hear 'em; and reply'd to his Civilities in ſo obliging a manner, that the Knight began to be ſmitten: beſides, he found her very acceptable to his Palate, a curious White Neck, and well turn'd lovely Arms, and of which ſhe did not ſeem to be niggardly. All this ſo inflam'd the Knight's Concupiſcence, that from Complements he proceeded to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Affection, and from tender Expreſſions to Dalliance, and ſo to the Act it ſelf. The miſchief was, that in the heat of their Amours, Fore-caſt was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they forgot to barr the Door; ſo that in the fury of the Venereal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, they never heard the pretended Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band come up Stairs, who for that reaſon ſurpriz'd 'em in illegal Conjunction. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s Choler appear'd all in his Face; out went the Inſtrument of his Wrath, with which he gave the naked Knight ſeveral cooling Slaps of equal Vertue to a Baſon of Water; who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of defending himſelf, would fain have been beholding to his Heels. But <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> reſolving to give him ſowre Sawce to his ſweet Meat, took him by the Collar; and as the other ſtruggl'd to get rid of a troubleſom Adverſary, off fell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63944:14"/>
his Perriwig, and diſcover'd a Shaven Crown <hi>Alamode de Virorum Sanctorum. La Chaiſe</hi> was not a little ſurpriz'd to find that the Perſon he had ſo well curry'd was a Prieſt; but he was almoſt aſtoniſh'd when he knew him to be Father <hi>de Vaux,</hi> his Preceptor in Philoſophy. How! <hi>(ſaid he,)</hi> Father, is it you! or do I ſee a Viſion? With that he ſurvey'd him from Head to Foot: And then, 'Tis He; the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual He, in his own proper Perſon, (added Signor <hi>Cornudo.</hi>) In good faith, moſt Reverend Father, I beg your Pardon for this rude Uſage of your Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but how was it poſſible for any Man to have known yee in this Diſguiſe? I would have allow'd fifteen Days to all the Fathers of your Convent to have found it out. The Jeſuite was ready to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Shame and Vexation; but ſeeing there was no remedy, he made a Vertue of Neceſſity. 'Tis very true, <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> 'tis I; and ſince you have diſcover'd me, 'tis in vain to make a Myſtery of the Buſineſs. You are a Perſon of Worth, and I hope you will uſe me like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> aſſur'd him, That he had all the reaſon i' the world to believe ſo, and that he might ſleep in quiet without ever being afraid of ſuffering by his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63944:14"/>
Afterwards, he told him how he had brought the Girl from <hi>Lion;</hi> and that he was carrying her to one of his Friends, to paſs away a little time with her, during the Vintage: That he might well thereby perceive that he was no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſon; and that if his Anger had tranſported him a little too far, when he found 'em together, 'twas rather to aſſert his Honour, then otherwiſe, and becauſe he look'd upon him as an unknown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that came to rob him of his Miſtreſs upon the King's High-way. But as for you, Sir, <hi>(continu'd he,)</hi> I am over-joy'd that ſhe pleaſes ye; and if you think her a Hand-maid fit for your farther Delight, you may take her along with you where you judge convenient. Civilities of this nature were not to be refus'd; ſo that the good Father accepted his Kindneſs, and teſtify'd his Acknowledgment to <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> by Embraces and Offers of his Service, which you would have thought would never have been at an end. From that time forward they ty'd themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a moſt ſtrict Bond of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And the better to faſten the Knot, they agreed to ſtay Eight Days together in the ſame place, and that the Woman ſhould be in Common between 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63944:15"/>After this, <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> being very curious to know the cauſe of his Diſguiſement, beſought him that he would be pleas'd to unfold the Truth. Which the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granted him with a wonderfull deal of frankneſs; well underſtanding that the beſt way to ſecure the Diſcretion of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is privy to our Secrets in ſpite of our Teeths, is to put an entire Confidence in him He declar'd then, that at the time that he lay at <hi>Chaalons,</hi> he had inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf into the Favour of a Rich Merchants Daughter, by whom he had had Two Children; that ſhe was marry'd about two or three years ſince, and liv'd in the Country near <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> where he had given her ſeveral Viſits already, in Secular Habit, and going for her Kinſman: that her Husband, who was a very good Man, had kindly entertain'd him; and that the ſame Occaſion had mov'd him to take another Journey in the Diſguiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſaw him; having made his Rector believe, that he was gone to ſee a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Dijon,</hi> his intimate Friend, and from whom he had counterfeited two or three Letters, importing earneſt Buſineſs. In ſhort, they conceal'd nothing one from the other; and their mutual Reliance one upon another produc'd ſuch a world of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63944:15"/>
Stories as would ſuffice to make a Volume. But in regard I have too many things of ſerious Conſequence to relate, I ſhall as ſlightly as I can, paſs over theſe Fooleries, and only touch upon 'em, when they are of abſolute neceſſity to diſplay the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of my <hi>Tartuff,</hi> and his Brethren in Iniquity.</p>
            <p>During their ſtay at the Inn, <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who tho' leud and debauch'd enough, however was not as yet accuſtom'd to Sin without ſome Scruple of Conſcience, could not forbear asking the Father ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, how he could reconcile his looſe way of Living, with his Obligations that were ſo oppoſite. For <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> you are oblig'd to Coelibacy by ſuch ſolemn Vows, the Breaches of which are attended by ſuch Terrible Penalties, that I wonder how you can ſo eaſily diſpence with 'em. They are not ſo Oppoſite as you think for, or as many People imagine <hi>(reply'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> there is a certain Moral which you underſtand not as yet, and which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver publickly teach in the Schools, becauſe indeed it is not expedient that all the World ſhould know it: we reſerve it for ſtrong Stomachs, and ſuch as are able to reliſh it; but be you careful, and I may in time impart it to your Knowledge,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63944:16"/>
and then you will hear Myſteries that will raviſh you with Admiration. I am apt to believe (<hi>reply'd</hi> La Chaiſe) that you will not conceal from me any part of your profound Learning; 'twas for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I ſubmitted my ſelf to your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; and you are oblig'd to it afreſh, by the Friendſhip which we have renew'd by mutual Oaths on both ſides; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Dear Father, vouchſafe to ſatisfie my Curioſity; and ſince we are here at Liberty together, why ſhould you deferr your Inſtructions till another time? I have Diſcretion and Wit enough now both to hear and learn. That's the thing of which I am not well convinc'd, <hi>(anſwer'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)</hi> for I aſſure ye, it requires a great deal of Wit and Diſcretion to underſtand our Morals. Suppoſe to your ſelf at firſt, that it ranverſes all other Morality, and that it leads ye through new and uncouth Ways, but yet more pleaſant, and leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd; when you have once unſhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kl'd your Heels from the Fetters of old and painfull Morality, and are become an eaſie Captive to our new and inviting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, you will find thoſe ſweet Acquieſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that Repoſe of Mind that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known before. For Example: Would not you be glad to have it made out to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63944:16"/>
ye, paſt all Contradiction, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for ye to recreate your ſelf with Mrs. <hi>Magdalen</hi> (for that was the Female Sinners Name) without committing a Sin, or any Snubbs of Conſcience. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, (<hi>replyld</hi> La Chaiſe) you could not do me a greater Kindneſs. Well then <hi>(quoth the Devout Father)</hi> ſet your Heart at reſt— take it from me, 'tis not a Sin that's worth the asking Pardon for. And this is according to the Deciſion of our greateſt Doctors, whom we call, and that juſtly too, The Guides to Salvation, and The Lights of the Church. Hear what the great <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> our Maſter ſays. <q>When a Man is ſo exceſſively provok'd by the Concupiſcence of the Fleſh, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Opportunity at hand to Commit Adultery, he diſtruſts his Weakneſs, and fears his Inability to defend himſelf from falling into the Tranſgreſſion; if ſuch a Man ſneaks into a Houſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and there extinguiſhes the Fire of his burning Luſt in the Boſome of a Punk, do's he commit a Sin? No, Becauſe he was afraid of committing Adultery, and he had no other way to ſhun it.</q> And in another Place, <q>A Man that finds himſelf quite overcome, and juſt ready to yield to a Temptation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63944:17"/>
that ſollicites him to abuſe the good Nature of a young Virgin that loves him, and would venture a Crack in her Honour for his ſake, commits no Sin, if to avoid this Miſchief he goes to a common Strumpet; to the end that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving allay'd the Violence of his Paſſion, he may be the more Maſter of himſelf and the more enabl'd to reſiſt the Charms of ſuch a ſtrong Temptation.</q> This is expreſs enough: but here is yet a clearer Deciſion of the ſame Doctor. <q>Of Two Evils, the leaſt is to be choſen; if it be impoſſible, but that you muſt commit either Adultery or Whoredom, avoid the Adultery; You have no other Courſe to take.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Suarez</hi> was of the ſame Opinion. <q>'Tis never to be diſputed, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> but that when a Man has not Strength enough to tame his Paſſions, he may have to do with debauch'd Women, once or more times, rather then do worſe. And in the ſame place, obſerve this well, I ſay farther, That if a Man be of ſo hot a Conſtitution, that he cannot live without a Woman, and that he cannot marry without ſome invincible Obſtacle, he ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Sin in keeping Company with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63944:17"/>
an unmarried Woman, till that Obſtacle be remov'd.</q> This is poſitive, and deciſive and makes as much for me, as it does for you. Then again, <hi>Diana,</hi> the moſt ſubtil of all our Caſuiſts, diſcourſes to a wonder upon this Subject, not leaving the ſlighteſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion un-reſolv'd. <q>A Man, <hi>(ſays he)</hi> who is conſtrain'd by the Strength of his Temptations, and the Temper of his Conſtitution, commits no Sin when he goes for his Satisfaction to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Stews, provided he pay the Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets; becauſe it is, at that time, their Trade, and the Calling which they live by, and they have no more Honour to loſe, nor any Reputation to be ſparing of: Not but that if the ſame Man, fearing to draw a Scandal upon himſelf, had rather keep a Whore in private, and lie with her as his Wife, 'twould be his better way. But <hi>(ſays he farther)</hi> it may be asked, Whether a Man may be conſtrain'd to it after a manner not to be diſpenc'd with. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Luſt of the Fleſh acts upon ſome Men, as Hunger upon the Stomach; if then it be agreed, That a Man who is extreamly preſs'd by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not able to buy, nor beg Bread, commits no Sin, if he ſteal no more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63944:18"/>

I know not how to return you Thanks <hi>(dear Father)</hi> anſwerable to the Obligation. I am not ſorry <hi>(anſwered the Father)</hi> for having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you theſe Inſtructions; though I muſt tell ye, you are not a little oblig'd to me for it, in regard theſe Secrets are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Indifferently to all; nay even in our Order, unleſs it be the the Profeſſors of Four Vows, very few others know theſe Things. How! (<hi>reply'd</hi> La Chaiſe) Do not all the Father Jeſuites know theſe Things? No,— not by a great many,

In our Houſe, for Example, there is only the Father Rector, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in Theology, the Father-Maſter, my Colleague, and my ſelf, that are of the Secret Doctrine. How! (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi>) What! not Father <hi>Le Champs,</hi> that Man of Wit and Parts, who pretends there is ne'er a Philoſopher in the World but himſelf? No — (reply'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) nor never ſhall be. He has a Head-piece but ill-furniſh'd, and abounds too much in his own Sence: our Secrets are not ſafe in the Hands of ſuch Men; we take care how we truſt 'em.

zealous in that reſpect. Father <hi>Alvar,</hi> among others, who was ſo highly in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having had the misfortune to be ſurpriz'd by the Duke <hi>de Sidonia</hi> a-bed with his Wife, was run through the Body in ſeveral places; and the Duke, not content with that, was ſo malicious as to revenge himſelf upon all the Jeſuites in general. To which purpoſe he ſent the wounded Body to the Houſe of the Profeſſion at Noon-day: which brought ſuch a Scandal upon 'em, both at the Court, and in the City, that our Fathers durſt not peep out of their Boroughs. However, Father <hi>Alvar</hi> did not die; he was carefully look'd to, cur'd, and liv'd a long time after. When he was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, there was a Conſultation, What was to be done upon ſuch an Important Occaſion as this. The greater part were not for letting the World know he was alive; by that means to free themſelves from being blam'd for not puniſhing him according to his Deſerts. But He gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly offer'd himſelf of his own accord; and told 'em, That ſince his bad Fortune had caus'd ſo great a Diſhonour to the Illuſtrious Order of which he had the Advantage to be a Member, and for the Glory of which he would ſacrifice a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

Lives, he would beg no Favour to be ſhew'd his Crime; and beſought the Fathers to Expell him their Body in the moſt authentick and ignominious manner that might be; to the end he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the Scape-Goat of all the Diſgrace and Infamy, and that the Society might be cleans'd with Hyſop from it. Which was done with a wonderful deal of ſorrow for being forc'd by a fatal Neceſſity to deal ſo ſeverely by ſo good a Man. But however, where-e'er he retir'd, there was nothing omitted for his Conſolation. They allow'd him forthwith an Annual Penſion of Two thouſand Crowns; and after that, they procur'd him a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which was worth above Two thouſand Livres more.

tell yee the reaſon (anſwer'd the Father) We rarely make our Superiors privy to our Adventures or Intrigues, for Two Cauſes. The Firſt, For that naturally every Man is willing to carry his own Buſineſs ſecretly; and becauſe infallibly they would never give us Permiſſion, <hi>not for any Scruple of Conſcience,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays very well; for their Conſciences are no way engag'd in the matter. In that reſpect, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Unus quiſque in ſuo ſenſu abundet:</hi> 
               <q>Let every man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in his own ſence.</q> But for the ſake of my Brother's Conſcience; <hi>Fit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem propter conſcientiam fratris mei,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the People, to whom we are to give no ſcandalous Examples. For it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Vae illi per quem ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum venit.</hi> Now in regard that an amorous Intrigue with a Maid or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is very ſubject to Diſcovery, unleſs you proceed with all the Precautions imaginable; which many times miſcarry too, as you ſee by what has happen'd ſo lately to my ſelf; therefore it is, that our Superiors have reſolv'd to ſuffer none at all, to prevent the great Diſorders which otherwiſe would fall out by their connivance. However, this does not hinder but that every particular Member
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63944:21"/>
may take his meaſures to divert himſelf the beſt he can, without any fear of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God, provided he carry his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cloſely and ſecretly. For then 'tis no Scandal to any Body but thoſe that think it ſo themſelves. <hi>Scio &amp; confido in Domino,</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul,) quod nihil commune eſt per ipſum, niſi ei qui exiſtimat quod com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune eſt.</hi> You interpret the Text ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi>) that he muſt be a very dull Soul indeed, that does not underſtand your meaning. But with Submiſſion, I muſt needs tell yee, That the Paſſages alledged out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by no means prove it lawful for a Prieſt to hold a carnal Familiarity with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for that the Apoſtle makes not the Diſtinction upon any Queſtion about Continence, but upon that about Meats ſacrificed to Idols. I find (reply'd the Father) that you have not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> otherwiſe you would have obſerv'd the ſame Indifferency in him in one reſpect as in the other; and therefore I did him no wrong to apply his Deciſion as to Abſtinence to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about Continency.

            <p>Theſe would be very proper Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi>) were the Diſpute about Lawful Marriage. You are much in the right o'nt, (reply'd the Jeſuite) but ſince it pleas'd our Lords aſſembl'd in Council to forbid us Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it behoves us to provide for our ſelves ſome other way: Neceſſity has no Law, you know it well enough; and it is ſo ancient a Truth, that we find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſeveral Examples of the Old Teſtament. <hi>Thamar,</hi> the fair Daughter of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſeeing that her Father-in-Law did not provide her a Second Husband, according to his Promiſe, and not being able to live without a Man, did ſhe not ſit waiting for him upon the High-way, in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63944:22"/>
the Dreſs of a Harlot, on purpoſe to allure her Father to get her with Child? and who knows but in that Diſguize ſhe might proſtitute her ſelf to ſeveral others? However, when he rightly underſtood the matter, he was ſo far from condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, that he ingenuouſly confeſs'd himſelf in an Error, and cry'd out to his Daughter, <hi>Me Juſtiores. Ruth,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Naomi,</hi> was ſhe not encourag'd and ſet on by her own Mother to go to bed to <hi>Boaz,</hi> after ſhe found that all the dumb Shews and Artifices that ſhe had made uſe of to put the good Man in mind of his Duty, had prov'd fruitleſs? And to deal freely with yee, In my Opinion, ſhe had a great deal of Reaſon for what ſhe did; for there is nothning ſo effectual to make a Man yield to Temptation, as a Pretty Woman a-bed with him. Would you have a more convincing Example then this, read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> how the Daughters of <hi>Lot</hi> behav'd themſelves. After they and their Father had made their Eſcapes from the Fire of <hi>Sodom,</hi> they found themſelves as good as Widows in the flower of their Age, when they had moſt need of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and out of hopes of ever having any, becauſe the Old Man would not let 'em marry to any but thoſe of his own

Religion; and whither to go for one of thoſe, they knew not. In the mean time, Deſire of Iſſue preſs'd 'em, and would not let 'em be at reſt; thereupon, without any Heſitation or Scruple of Conſcience, they ſo order'd it, as to make their own Father quench their Fires. Nor does the Scripture blame 'em for it in the leaſt. What d'yee ſay to all this? (added he)— If you have any Objections to make, why don't yee make 'em? What ſhould I ſay? (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) You have ſtopt my Mouth; and I find your Reaſons ſo appoſite and convincing, that I ſubmit with the greateſt Pleaſure i' the world; raviſh'd with Joy that I have found ſo ſhort and ſo commodious a Way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for I make no queſtion, but that you are able to remove all my other leſſer Scruples, who have thus dextrouſly rid me of my greater Doubts. Ay, Ay, we'll remove 'em at any time, I warrant thee, (reply'd the Father, graſping him hard by the Hand) Alas, it would be great pity to leave a poor Conſcience to be prey'd upon by the Stings and Worms that infeſt it. Do but you ſubmit your ſelf to Inſtruction, and never trouble your ſelf any farther. You have no more to do but to come to me regularly every day in

private, and I will diſcover to yee the bottom and Marrow of true Theology and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of which others only know the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rind and Shell. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> gave him a thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thanks, and promis'd him an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Devotion of his Fortune and Perſon to the Society, and to him in particular.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how furiouſly and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Men give themſelves up to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flatters their Paſſion and Irregularity. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> was of this number; his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation carry'd him to Vice and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and made him ſlight all the Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Admonitions of his Conſcience. No wonder then, that he ſo greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd a Doctrine that annihilates all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sin by authoriſing it, and ſooths up the Wicked with an Inſenſibility and a Lethargy ſo dear to 'em.</p>
            <p>This was the Foundation and Original of that conſtant Amity which continu'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Perſons, as you ſhall hear by the Sequel. But before they parted, they bethought themſelves which way to continue the Commerce between Father <hi>de Vaux</hi> and the Damſel. For in regard ſhe was Common and Publick, he could not go to her Lodging without great prejudice to his Reputation, upon any Pretence whatſoever. Thereupon it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63944:23"/>
That ſhe ſhould put herſelf into Man's Apparel, and go two or three times a Week to the Father's Chamber, under the Name of Sieur <hi>Le Brun,</hi> of the pretended Reformed Religion, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mind to quit his Profeſſion, deſir'd firſt to be ſatisfy'd in ſome Scruples: and they gave her a Part which ſhe acted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well for ſome time. But there happen'd an Adventure which had like to have ſpoil'd all. The Father-Maſter, who was an <hi>Italian,</hi> and one of thoſe that are more addicted to the moſt infamous of Pleaſures, obſerving the great Zeal of this Young Man in purſuance of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and his Aſſiduity to be inſtructed in order to it, miſtruſted that there was ſome Myſtery at the bottom which all the World did not underſtand; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirm'd every day more then other of his Suſpicions, reſolv'd to watch 'em ſo narrowly, that they ſhould not eſcape his better Satisfaction. To which purpoſe he left nothing omitted, and had often try'd to find out ſome Hole to peep into his Chamber. But Father <hi>De Vaux</hi> had ſo diligently ſtop'd up all the Chinks, that all his Attempts to diſcover any thing that way, prov'd in vain. However, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Precaution confirm'd him more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63944:24"/>
and more that he lay under no Miſtake; beſides that, he ſaw the fair Novitiate come every day, which wonderfully augmented his Deſires. At length he found a way to ſee with his own Eyes what he had ſuch a mind to know; and that too, much better then he could have done through the Chinks of the Door. One day, that happen'd to be a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Holy-day, he fain'd himſelf ſick; which was a lawful Excuſe for his not going to the Quire; and at the ſame time that the reſt were at their Devotions, up he got, with a Wimble in his Hand, and went to Father <hi>De Vaux</hi>'s Chamber-Door, where he made a ſloping Hole, from whence he could ſee directly to his Bed: after which he ſtop'd it up with a Peg of the ſame Colour, and ſo exactly, that it was as much as he could doe to pick it out again, when he had occaſion, with the Point of a Pen-knife. This done, he returned to his Bed, very well ſatisfy'd with his Day's Work. All that Day he lay perdue. At length the handſom Lad, who had ſo much diſturb'd his Reſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Father's Chamber, and away went he to his Poſt; where, in a little time, he obſerv'd how the good Father Catechi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'d his Pupil. He let 'em alone
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63944:24"/>
till the Father was juſt ready to enter the Port; but then he bounc'd with ſo much Impatience, that Father <hi>De Vaux,</hi> who had hardly time to put on his Cloaths, was in a peck of Troubles. Well, in ſhort, he open'd the Door, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Novices entring, and ſhutting it after him, In truth, Father (ſaid he) you take a moſt pleaſant Courſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Hereticks: your Zeal is extremely to be commended, and ought to be made known; and therefore I ſhall not fail to inform the whole Fellowſhip, to the end they may conſider of a Way to Reward yee according to your Merit. What d'yee mean? (reply'd Father <hi>De Vaux,</hi>) Pray explain your ſelf more clearly; for I profeſs, I underſtand ye not. I mean (anſwer'd the Father-Maſter) That if you did not deſire to be ſeen, you ſhould have taken better Meaſures. You had exactly well ſtopp'd up all the Chinks and Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Door, but by misfortune you did not heed the biggeſt, ſhewing him that which he had made the day before. Oh! — (cry'd Father <hi>De Vaux,</hi>) you have betray'd me — but for all that, you will not be believ'd. — Good God! (quo' the Father-Maſter,) Not be believ'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſimply you talk; — But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63944:25"/>
let us take the wiſeſt Courſe — Give me a ſhare of the Cake, and there ſhall not a word be ſaid more—You are a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man, and know the common Practiſe upon ſuch Occaſions as theſe — I have as much Zeal as you, and ſhould be glad to give ſome Inſtructions alſo to this well-meaning Youth. Father <hi>De Vaux</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Propoſal, and the Bargain was concuded upon the ſpot. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Father addreſs'd himſelf to the young Spark; but in the mid'ſt of his Careſſes found him to be a Girl; which did not a little vex him, in regard that Males were more pleaſing to his Palate then Females; but for want of better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, he made uſe of what he had.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had finiſh'd his ſtudies in Philoſophy; and one day as he was walking with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>De Vaux,</hi> Well, (ſaid he to his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,) and what Courſe of Life or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do you intend to follow? for it is now high-time to bethink your ſelf — You are very near Twenty Years of Age, and thoſe Years require that you ſhould begin to look about yee.</p>
            <p>In truth, Father, (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) the more I think of it, the leſs I know

my own Mind — 'Tis a Buſineſs of great Conſequence— Pray Father, give me your Advice. — With all my heart, (reply'd the Father) but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me to know your Inclinations, and how your Parents ſtand affected. My Parents (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) would have me betake my ſelf to the Barr; more-eſpecially my Mother has a ſtrange Fancy for that Employment. But for my part, when I conſider how little I have to truſt to at home, I mind but little their Directions. I am a Perſon of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and very Ambitious withal; and I am for making my Fortune, I care not how, nor which way. What ſhould I do with a long Gown, that have no Money to buy Offices? I ſhould rather chuſe to be a Soldier; for ſo I might hope to be a Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> Beſides that, we find many who were but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Corporals, that now ride in their lacker'd Coaches: What think you, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If you would take my Advice, (anſwer'd the Father) you ſhall neither be Lawyer nor Soldier. As for the firſt, you have very well obſerv'd, That there is no Advancement to be got by it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money; and I ſay the ſame of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which you have not mention'd: and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63944:26"/>
as for being a Soldier, that's leſs your Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs then either of the other two. We live not now in thoſe Times when the Bravery of a Soldier was ſufficient to make him a Captain, and to advance him to be a General. 'Tis in the Army, as every where elſe, if your Money does not make the Diſtinction firſt of all, were you a <hi>Caeſar</hi> in Valour, you may carry a Snap-ſack as long as you live, and the Generals never know whether ever there were any ſuch Man living i' the World. How many Soldiers have perform'd ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Actions, that in Twenty four Hours were utterly forgot. I confeſs, there are ſome who attain to Preferment, but they are very rare; and if you can name Ten, there are Fifty thouſand to be oppos'd againſt every one that have periſh'd through Hunger and Miſery. Add to this, That it is a Trade whereby nothing is to be got but by dry Blows. An Iron Arm, or a Woodd'n Leg, are the chiefeſt Reward of your Services, and happy he too that ſcapes ſo. Then again, Are you able to endure all the Fatigues inſeparable from War, as Heat, Cold, Hunger, Lying upon the Ground, and ſometimes in the Water, the Wind and Rain, and all the Injuries of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

Marching at all Hours, and all Seaſons; want of Sleep, and a thouſand more. For my part, I am of Opinion, That Reſt and Eaſe are two the chiefeſt Bleſſings we enjoy; and that none but Mad-men preferr Tumult, Blood and Slaughter before 'em.</p>
            <p>You raviſh me with your Diſcourſe (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) the main thing is, how to come at this Reſt and Eaſe. For I muſt confeſs ingenuouſly, That had I Ten thouſand Livres a Year, I would never ſeek for 'em other-where then at home; but in regard I have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to live, I muſt be forc'd to take ſome courſe or other. Very good (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Father) — What think yee of being a Jeſuite? — You cannot take a better Courſe — Let it Blow, let it Thunder, you ſhall be always ſure of good Bread, good Cloaths, a ſoft Bed, and to be honour'd and reſpected by all Men — What would yee have more? I do not believe 'twill ſuit with my Genius reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) I love my Pleaſures, and am afraid of every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Reſtraint and Subjection, or any other Torment of the Mind. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (quo' the Father, interrupting him) that you ſhould remember ſo little of all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63944:27"/>
that which I entruſted to your Breaſt— Good now, who told you that Pleaſures were baniſh'd from our Society? Did you ever ſee the contrary with your own Eyes? Or do you find me to be a Man that is irreconcilable to all Mankind? All the reſt are like my ſelf; that is to ſay, all thoſe that may be truly call'd Jeſuits. We love good Chear, the Fair Sex, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Preferments; and we have got the knack to enjoy all theſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any Scandal to any body, or wounding our own Conſciences. Name me, if you can, any other Body or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Men, any Condition of People in the World, where you ſhall find the ſame Advantages.</p>
            <p>What you ſay, Father, is very true, (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) and enough to make a deep Impreſſion in my Mind; but I cannot away with a Life ſo level and ſmooth, without any change or variety, as yours: ſuch as the firſt day is, ſuch is the ſecond; they neither Aſcend nor Deſcend, which in my Opinion is a very melancholy and irkſom manner of living. For my part, I ſhould like a little Motion, a little Intrigue; not to lie ſtill i' the World immoveable like a Stone, without having any ſhare in the Buſtle of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:63944:27"/>This was that which I expected from yee, (reply'd the Father,) but if this be all that withholds yee, I find I ſhall fix your Reſolutions before you go out of this Garden. You muſt know then, that there is no Society of Men in the World that plunge themſelves into Buſineſs more then we do, or where Men of Wit and Merit more eaſily advance themſelves: ſuch Men as theſe are ſought after with all the care imaginable; and you would wonder, at the end of five or ſix Years, to ſee 'em Heads of a Party. Good Luck and Preferment, are ſo frequent among us, and ſo Prodigious as paſſes Imagination. <hi>Peter Gerard,</hi> our Aſſiſtant-General, is the Son of a Cobler of <hi>Reims;</hi> and Father <hi>Creps,</hi> the preſent Emperor's Confeſſor, is the Son of a Hat-maker: and as for our preſent Provincial, as great a Lord as he is, I knew my ſelf, that when he came firſt to the College, he had not Shoes to his Feet; yet now he is grown a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Man, takes State upon him, and gives all the World occaſion to talk of him. Were you one of the Ordinary, one of thoſe Petty Genius's that are to be won by Reaſons that carry a General Vogue, I could tell ye, That there is no Society in the World more Holy then the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63944:28"/>
               <hi>Society of Jeſus,</hi> which every day ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices her deareſt Children for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Turks and Pagans, among whom they are continually ſent; and that 'tis a ſign that God accepts the Blood of his Martyrs, ſince he permits ſo many Millions of Souls, even whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to be Converted to the Faith by this Means. I could give you a Liſt of all the famous Doctors that our Order has produc'd; of ſeveral Kings and Princes that have deſir'd Admittance into it; and of the Favours that God has beſtow'd upon us through the Interceſſion of our Saints and bleſſed Members. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard you are my Friend, and a Man of Sence, I ſhall tickle your Fancy another way, and bait my Hook to catch ſuch Dolphins as you with your own Worldly Intereſt, which ought upon all Occaſions to be your principal Aim. For as for your Salvation, you may look after that as well in a King's Palace, as in an Anchoret's Cell. And to this purpoſe I ſhall give you a True and Natural Idea of the Congregation in general.</p>
            <p>Set before your Eyes a Little, but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Republick, from whence Poverty and Miſery are abſolutely baniſh'd; where the leaſt Happy and the leaſt Conſiderable
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63944:28"/>
have enough to ſtop their Mouths from complaining of Fortune, and largely to ſupply all the Neceſſities of Humane Life, without being oblig'd to work and tyre themſelves. A State wherein you never hear any Diſcourſe of Wars, Torments, Taxes or Impoſts; where for want of Payment, you are never expos'd to the Taunts and Threats of a Creditor, or to the Affronts of Bailiffs; a Country where you may live in Peace and Gladneſs, without fearing leſt a Knave of a Debtor ſhould Break in your Debt; or that an Enemy ſhould ſet fire to your Barns, without being diſturb'd in Mind, becauſe the laſt Harveſt was not ſo good as the former. But imagine, That in theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Iſlands you have your Corn ready Thraſh'd in your Barns, your Wine ready Tunn'd up in your Cellars, and your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble regularly ſpread without taking any Care, and carking where you ſhall Dine. Nor is this all; the Government of this State is purely Democratical; every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon has a ſhare in it, more or leſs; and that which is the chiefeſt thing of all, there is no Injuſtice done to any Body. The moſt conſiderable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are diſtributed and proportion'd according to Merit, without any Reſpect
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63944:29"/>
to precedency of Birth; ſo that Wit and Ability are ſufficient to entitle a Man to the Higheſt Dignities; to which, when a Man has once attain'd, he enjoys 'em for Life; he knows no ſuch Thing as Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſement of Fortune. Now tell me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, do's not this faithful Deſcription move yee? and would not you be glad to be admitted into ſuch a Government? However what I have told ye already, is but a Trifle to what I am going to tell ye; and yet as true as the reſt.</p>
            <p>This Petty Republick by her wiſe Laws and prudent Conſtitutions, is arriv'd at the Univerſal Monarchy, to which ſo many Kings and Emperors have in vain aſpir'd; and all this too, without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sword, or ſhedding ſo much as one drop of Blood, or making uſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther means but only Perſwaſion.

it not to be admir'd that ſhe has ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accompliſh'd all this, without Armies and Soldiers, and that ſhe has ſo eaſily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her ſelf? True it is, that this Wiſe and wonderfull Government has not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exempted from Misfortunes: we have ſeen that certain People have revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her, and with Ignominy have expell'd ſome of her Communities. But theſe were Tempeſts that have been ſoon allay'd by the prudent Conduct of thoſe that ſteer the Helm of Affairs; ſo that they have return'd Victorious into thoſe Places from whence they have been ejected with Diſgrace. You laugh (continu'd the Father, looking upon <hi>La Chaiſe;</hi>) however I tell ye no Fables; and if you do but conſider, you will find that I have told yee nothing but what is certain, and that I have given yee a True Emblem of our Order. For in ſhort, it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that it is at this Day the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of all the Potentates of <hi>Europe;</hi> we form not only a State in a State, but a State in ſeveral States, and a Regnant Republick, in the Univerſal Republick; and therein conſiſts our great Advantage: for if by Misfortune we loſe on the one ſide, we are always certain to gain on the other. And how indeed is it poſſible we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63944:30"/>
ſhould miſcarry, ſince we play ſure. There is not any Secret in the Cabinets of Kings or Princes but we can fiſh it out. We have People every where that inform us of every Thing; and who ſuffer not any Reſolutions to be taken contrary to our Intereſts. Which being ſo, do you not ſee that we are the Perſons that Reign and Govern, tho' indirectly?</p>
            <p>'Tis ſomething that cannot but chooſe to be very tickling to a Jeſuit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in great Affairs, and to ſee himſelf careſs'd by a Prince who thinks him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Inſtrument to carry on his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. You have then a fair Field to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate in, and if you do but never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle know how to manage Fortune, there are no Grandeurs, to which you may not aſpire.</p>
            <p>But (ſaid <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) 'tis a Thing would be known, whether I may be ſo happy to be admitted of the Number. Never doubt it (reply'd the Father) you have a ſmooth, inſinuating, flattering Wit, and a little Knaviſh withall; nor do you want a quick and fiery Imagination, which however deſtroys not the Solidity of your Judgment. Theſe are the People that we want, and with ſuch Talents as theſe you can never fail of Succeſs. Believe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63944:30"/>
me then; be one of Us, and you will find your ſelf no loſer by the Bargain: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I would not have you take up this Reſolution before you underſtand us right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore come and ſee me every day, and I will diſcover to yee the moſt Hidden Maxims of our Secret Doctrine. After this, he carry'd him into the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and gave him <hi>Eſcobar, Diana, Matchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> &amp;c. Here (ſaid he) are Books worth Gold, read 'em, and pick what you can out of 'em; to morrow you ſhall give me an Account of what you have obſerv'd, and we will diſcourſe together. After this, they took their Leaves, and <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> went home.</p>
            <p>The next day he return'd to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, at what time Father <hi>de Vaux,</hi> no ſooner ſaw him, but he ask'd him whether he had read any Thing. Yes, (ſaid <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi>) I began with <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> becauſe he treats of Politicks, which is a Study that I reliſh very well; 'tis a very good Book, and I aſſure yee I read on with a great deal of Pleaſure. Oh — (ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>de Vaux,</hi> interrupting him,) he is a moſt wonderfull Man, and one whoſe Deciſions we admit in Matter of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with as much ſatisfaction as thoſe of <hi>Eſcobar</hi> himſelf.

to ſpeak in general, they are very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but there are ſome that are alſo very bold: as for Example, he aſſerts, That one or more Perſons, tho' People of Worth and Probity, tho' they have done the State important Services, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd, when the Publick Good is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and that upon ſuch an occaſion: Prince ought not to ſcruple the violating of his Word and Promiſe, nor the moſt ſacred Treaties.

               </gap>. How!

               </gap> ſee the Abſurdity of this Propoſition; and it is the ſame in reſpect of the Faith of Treaties, which, as you pretend, ſhould be inviolably preſerv'd: for you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, my Dear, that a Prince is to have no other Proſpect in his Eye then the Wellfare of his Kingdom; that is to be the Center of all his Actions and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63944:31"/>
as it is only for the Good of his Kingdom that he makes Treaties, they are to be look'd upon no otherwiſe then as the Means to attain that End. But ſo ſoon as through the Revolution of things here below, and the Conjuncture of Times, thoſe Means become Obſtacles, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That from that very time, thoſe Treaties are diſſolv'd, becauſe they no longer concurr to the End for which they were made.</p>
            <p>I know this very well (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) but after all, of neceſſity, this Doctrine trails after it very evil Conſequences, and gives a very fair and large Liberty to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to break all manner of Allyances, the moſt ſolemnly ſworn, and to invade their Neighbours when they think themſelves the moſt ſecure. No queſtion of it (reply'd the Father) and it is one of the moſt Noble Prerogatives of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. Certainly a Prince would be a very miſerable Creature, if he were ſo ty'd to his Word, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unlooſe himſelf from it. Every time you argue upon this Subject, never wag from the Principle, which is the only Foundation upon which you are to build; <hi>viz.</hi> A Prince is to have no

other Proſpect in his Eye, then the Good and Glory of his Kingdom. So then he may do any thing to procure it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he be a Catholick; and if he has a ſufficient Strength to Conquer all the World, we give him free Liberty to do it. 'Tis true, that in ſo doing, he will Dethrone ſeveral Kings and Princes that for ſeveral Ages enjoy'd the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Sovereignty; he will ſtrike Dread and Terrour where-ever h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OUR Father Rector has reſolv'd, by my Advice, to ſend You this New Coad-jutor, to ſtudy Theology under the Direction of Your Reverence. He had a Deſign to have ſent him to Father <hi>Le Gouſt,</hi> at <hi>Chaalon;</hi> however I diſſwaded him, though with much adoe; my perfect Devotion to your Intereſts, not permitting me to ſuffer, that a Perſon ſo hopeful, and promiſing, ſhould be preferr'd to any other but your ſelf. For I muſt do him that Juſtice, that I never ſaw any one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that was ever ſtock'd with proner In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations for our purpoſe. He has an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Memory, a quick Imagination, a ſmooth, and flattering Wit, is a Maſter in the Art of Diſſimulation, and never did Man know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to keep a Secret. Under the outward ſhew of a ſingular open-heartedneſs, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates himſelf, with ſo much eaſe, to all ſorts of Humours, and Genius's, as if he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Inclinations, but theirs. In a word, he is a <hi>Proteus,</hi> that can change him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63944:36"/>
into all Forms, and carries 'em ſo well, that they ſeem to be natural to him. Now, Reverend Father, judge what may be expected from ſuch a hopeful young Man of ſo much Merit: He has enough in him to make one of the greateſt Men of the Order. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him therefore, with all the Affections of my Heart to your Reverence, and beg of yee not to deny him the Knowledge of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Doctrine: for though he be but Young, his Wit, and his rare Talants ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before all other Conſiderations. It is but Juſt, that they who are ſo ſignally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd ſhould enjoy ſome Privilege above others. If your Reverence vouchſafes me this Favour, as I dare preſume you will, I ſhall be no leſs ſenſible of it, then if I had receiv'd it my ſelf. Honour me with Your Commands, and never queſtion the Sincerity, with which I profeſs my ſelf to be Yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1649, 1650."/> Being arriv'd at proper years, he was ordain'd a Prieſt, and ſome time after preach'd with general Applauſe. Soon after he was ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he remain'd ſeveral years in the Houſe in St. <hi>James</hi>'s-ſtreet; and in regard that vaſt and populous City is the moſt proper Place in the World for Intreagues and Caballs, <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> in a ſhort time became one of the moſt forward and active upon thoſe Occaſions; ſo that within the ſpace of Five years that he tarry'd there, he knew and was known to a great Number of Eminent Perſons. Nor did his eaſie Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Perſons of Quality, beget in him a Neglect of Men of Learning, whoſe Company he much frequented, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intimate with ſome of 'em. Among others M. <hi>de Benſerade,</hi> and M. <hi>de Scarron,</hi> were of his familiar Acquaintance; and the latter had enter'd into ſo ſtrict a Friendſhip with him, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a day went over their Heads but they were together. And indeed, I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſay this in praiſe of Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> that he had always a great Eſteem for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63944:37"/>
Learned Men; whether it were, that by that means he would perſwade the World that he were ſo himſelf, or that it were the Effect of his own Inclination, I will not determine. Beſides, he was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his Friendſhips contracted; as for Example, with Father <hi>de Vaux,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spen,</hi> as much a Huguenot as he was, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others. 'Tis true that his Intereſt had always a ſhare in his Friendſhip; for he had receiv'd a Thouſand Kindneſſes from all thoſe Perſons; whereas, whenever he did them any, 'twas always to be believ'd that he conſider'd himſelf in the firſt place. Under this Hypotheſis, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend whatever he did for Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi> the Widow of his good Friend. For what could he do more for his own Intereſt, then to ſet up for a Favourite, a Woman of whom he had been ſo well aſſur'd for ſo long a time. However it were, that little Good which glimmers in him is clouded with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the abounding Crimes of his Life. But let us return to our Hiſtory.</p>

&amp; aqua Anguſtiae.</hi> But the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, who preſided in the Aſſembly, and whoſe Right it was to pronounce the Definitive Sentence, made uſe of this variety of Sentiments, to help his Friend out of the Mire, and therefore addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf in his turn to the Society, he told 'em, <q>That he could not blame the pious Zeal of the whole Society; nevertheleſs, that he was oblig'd to put 'em in mind, That when there was an incumbent Neceſſity to condemn any Perſon, they could not act with too much Moderation, becauſe it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fell out, That our proper Paſſions diſguiſing themſelves under the plauſible Appearance of Zeal for God, tranſported us to utmoſt Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Brother, who, by that means, became a Victim: but that then, not conſidering what we did, we ſacrific'd to the Devil, traveſty'd into an Angel of Light; which cautious, and evil Spirit, not caring how he brought Men to Perdition, provided they were deſtroy'd, had made too great a uſe of this ſame fatal Means to Damn an infinite number of Souls, which but for that, would be in a happy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63944:49"/>
That it behov'd us to have this Fear before our Eyes, and after the Example of all the moſt eminent Saints, always to lean toward Charity, which was the Soul of all Vertues, without which, they are no more then a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chaos, according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul:</hi> To whatever Extremity we encline on this ſide, we can never Sin, whereas, on the other ſide, we cannot be too cautious, as the ſame Apoſtle ſhews us. That he did not take upon him to palliate, or leſſen the Crime committed by the guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which to ſay the Truth was very Enormous, but that Chriſt himſelf had taught us, That there was Mercy to be ſhew'd upon all Sins, more eſpecially when it was merited by Repentance; and that after all, altho' this poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had had the Misfortune to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by Temptation, and an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity at hand, the effect of humane Frailty, yet for all that, he might come to be a worthy Man, and a great Saint: That St. <hi>Peter</hi> fell into a Crime much more heinous then His; nevertheleſs, we do not find in Scripture, that ever the reſt of the Apoſtles call'd him to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63944:49"/>
an Account for it: He only wept, and they believ'd his Tears ſincere; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted his Repentance, and their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would not permit 'em for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doubt the Truth of his Words. Wherefore then Brethren, ſhould you now be of an Opinion ſo oppoſite to theirs? Why ſhould you eſtrange your ſelves ſo far from the Example which they ſet before you? or, Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater? Read then what our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Judas,</hi> though he knew him to be a Traytor, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, and worthy of Death. He was ſo far from ſevere Uſage, or Excluding him from the Holy Society, or forbidding the Diſciples from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with him, that he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to his Table without Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As for my part, Brethren, (purſu'd he) that which I have here to ſay, as already I have given you to underſtand, is not in order to take part with Vice. The whole Society, and all the Order in general, will bear witneſs for me, that I have never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any occaſion of Scandal to any Perſon; I am neither Raviſher, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, nor Whore-monger, nor Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,

Among the reſt, there was one particularly to be taken notice of with Donna <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gareta del Caniglio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1657:</note> the Cardinal <hi>Padron</hi>'s near Kinſwoman, who fail'd but very narrowly of procuring him a Biſhop's Croſier, had not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, out of a peculiar Diſcontent, refus'd it but a little before to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who begg'd it for Father <hi>Davila,</hi> at that time Aſſiſtant-General of <hi>Spain.</hi> Which ruin'd all Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s Hopes, and diſappointed all the Canvaſſings that were made uſe of in his behalf. But for all this, he was well eſteem'd in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. then Pope, lent him a willing Ear, and employ'd him in ſeveral Negotiations, wherein he acquitted himſelf with good Succeſs. And well it was for the Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> that the Father was ſo much in the Pope's Favour, for otherwiſe he might have had but an ill time of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:63944:52"/>This Prelate was one of thoſe whom nothing will ſerve but to be Petty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns in Spirituals, and who refuſe to acknowledge the Holy See, but only <hi>ad Honores.</hi> He had already play'd ſeveral Pranks of a Petty Lord and Maſter, by permitting People in his Dioceſs to work on Holy-days, only ſome few excepted; by granting Indulgences, and giving Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations beyond the Limits of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which had very much incens'd the Pope againſt him. But that which was the Complement of all the reſt, and contributed to make him a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, was an Action that made a great Noiſe, no way to be endur'd by the Pope. There was in his Dioceſs a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Abby, belonging to the Benedictines not reform'd, call'd the Abby of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which depended ſolely upon the Pope, and which, till then, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that Privilege to themſelves; but he not enduring thoſe Dependencies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Noſe, pretended to a Right of Viſitation of their Houſe, and to that purpoſe went to the Convent. The Monks refus'd to admit him; However, having open'd their Door out of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that they might not provoke
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63944:52"/>
him to be their Enemy, ſhew'd him their Grants, and their Patents for the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Immunity; of which the Biſhop not only took the leaſt notice, but taking the Benefit of the Entrance that had been given him, made a verbal Report upon the Spot. Upon which, the Monks finding him to be in Earneſt, ſtood upon their Terms, and ſent away both their Complaints, and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to <hi>Rome;</hi> whereupon the Pope gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em a Bull, prohibiting the Biſhop, under pain of Apoſtolick Cenſures not to impoſe any Innovations upon 'em. The Fathers, ſo ſoon as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd this Bull, caus'd it to be fix'd up upon the Doors of the Cathedral, which ſo provok'd the Biſhop, that as he went out from High Maſs he pull'd it down, and tore it in pieces with his own Hands; and within a few Days after, in deſpite of the Monks, he made his Viſitation in the Convent, after he had caus'd the Doors to be broke open. Such an Act of Violence ſo incens'd the Holy Father againſt him, that he threaten'd him with nothing leſs then Excommunication; and then it was, that Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Biſhop's Friend while he reſided

in <hi>Paris,</hi> was employ'd to attone the Pope; but it coſt him a great deal of trouble to bring it to paſs; and a ſmall Accident happen'd at the ſame time, which had like to have let flye the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that grumbl'd ſo terribly. For the Monks ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> an Ordinance of that Biſhop, at the top of which the Biſhop ſtyl'd himſelf <hi>Biſhop Miſeratione Dei,</hi> without making any mention of the Holy-See. The Pope ſaw it, and foaming with Anger, <hi>Ecco</hi> (ſaid He) <hi>Un Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſo Barone, con il ſuo Miſeratione di dio; voglio bene che Sappia, che non e Veſcovo che per la mia; e che quando vorrò non ſerà piu ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente:</hi>

            <p>Now, in regard this Biſhop was one of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Creatures, his Eminency wrote to <hi>Rinaldo d' Eſte,</hi> Protector of

the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> and enjoin'd him to wait upon his Holineſs about this Affair. And indeed, he made a great number of Jaunts to and fro, without making any Progreſs: for the Pope, who had already thunder'd out a Bull of Excommunication againſt him, would not yield a hair's breadth, unleſs the Biſhop came himſelf in Perſon to acknowledge his Fault, and beg his Mercy. Thus the Affair was ſpun out for above a Twelve-month, and in all likelyhood would have laſted a great while longer, had not <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> found out an Expedient, that the Excommunicated Biſhop ſhould make an Acknowledgment at <hi>Paris,</hi> before the Nuncio, and write to his Holineſs a ſubmiſſive and reſpectful Letter; wherein he was to beg Pardon for his Diſobedience, and ſet forth his Repentance in moſt ſignificant Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. After which, his Holineſs ſhould take off the Excommunication; which was to be read in the Body of the High-Maſs in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Bayeux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> did a conſiderable piece of Service alſo for his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which did not a little contribute to advance his Reputation. There ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63944:54"/>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> toward the end of the Pontificate of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. an ancient Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a Venerable Preſence, who wore Long Hair, with his Locks flowing over his Shoulders, and a Beard down to his Belly. This Jeſuit took upon him the Title of Embaſſador from the King of <hi>China</hi> to his Holineſs, whom he came to aſſure of the barbarous Monarch's Reſpect and Filial Obedience to the Holy See, and to deſire a new Supply of Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries to labour the Converſion of a numerous People who waited for the Succour of his Charity. The only Son of that King was alſo come in Perſon to kiſs his Holineſs's Feet, and render the Embaſſie the more Authentick. The Pope was over-joy'd beyond Imagination to hear of ſuch a happy Progreſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in thoſe far diſtant Regions: and not being able to teſtifie his Satisfaction to the Prince of <hi>China,</hi> whoſe Zeal had engag'd him to croſs ſo many vaſt and dangerous Seas, he lodg'd him magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and gave Order, That both He and the Embaſſador of the King his Father, ſhould be entertain'd at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, during their ſtay in <hi>Rome;</hi> and moreover, he pay'd him all the Honours
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63944:54"/>
that are uſually pay'd to the Sons of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes.</p>
            <p>But the Dominicans, who are no Friends to Jeſuits, and leſs in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where Miſſionaries are employ'd, then otherwhere, utterly deſtroy'd all this fine Story. They wrote to the Pope, That underſtanding the Jeſuits had counterfeited an Embaſſie from the King of <hi>China,</hi> and had alſo Perſonated the Son of that Monarch, which was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Impoſture, They could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give his Holineſs Advice of it, for fear he ſhould fall into the Snare, that only tended to advance the Jeſuits Reputation, and to procure him to part with conſiderable Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the Support of the Miſſion; whereas the King of <hi>China,</hi> who was then at War with the Tartars, had no thoughts of turning Catholick, much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor do I believe that any Lady in the Kingdom would have refus'd 'em. Your Affection for him has had an extraordinary good Effect. For it has drawn him off from his Engagements begun with Madam his Siſter-in-Law; which made me tremble a thouſand times, out of that Zeal which I have for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Salvation. So that it may be ſaid, That your Charms have reſcu'd his Royal Soul from a greater Danger, into which it was falling. — <hi>La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi> who deſir'd no more, then that he would prove by ſubſtantial Reaſons, that ſhe might Love the King with a ſafe

Conſcience, liſten'd very attentively till he had made an end of ſpeaking. After which (ſaid ſhe, fetching a deep Sigh) How happy ſhould I be, if the Father-Confeſſor were but in ſome meaſure of your Opinion. But he continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the King upon this Occaſion; and moreover, incenſes the Queen againſt me, and urges her to perſecute me with all the Vexations imaginable. There's more Truth in that then you can well believe (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) for I have left the Queen's Chamber twenty times, not being able to hear how bitterly ſhe inveighs againſt you, Madam, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contradiction, are the Perſon in the World who moſt naturally deſerves her Kindneſs and Reſpect. In a word, What ſhall I ſay to yee, Madam, but that that ſame Old Fool has got a certain Notion of Morality in his Brain, which he takes to be pure Devotion, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines there is no Salvation without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Diſſimulation. You have hit his true Character (anſwer'd <hi>La Valliere</hi>) and therefore it is that the King begins to diſguſt him, and only retains him out of meer Reſpect: but I intend to ſpeak to the King concerning him this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if he believes what I ſay, we
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63944:61"/>
ſhall ſhift him off to ſay his Prayers by himſelf. After that, Reverend Father, you ſhall have a good ſhare in the next Nomination, or elſe ſay I can do nothing. I would as willingly have you the King's Confeſſor as my own, and therefore relye upon my Word. The Father return'd her a thouſand Thanks, and aſſur'd her that ſhe ſhould never have any cauſe to repent of her procuring him that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. After which, in regard it was late, and for that ſhe expected the King, he took his leave of her, and retir'd with Thoughts full freighted with the Idea's of his future Grandeur.</p>
            <p>He ſlept not all that Night, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but little the Nights following. For he is a Man whom Ambition ſuffers the leaſt to take his Reſt of any Man that I know, as one that is always indefatigable in the purſuit of his Ends. There is not any Conjuncture which he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how to make uſe of to a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Of which his Viſit to <hi>La Valliere</hi> is a palpable Demonſtration. 'Twas a thing that requir'd great Judgment, and a quick Reſolution: for had he abſolutely refus'd what ſhe demanded of him, and not thrown himſelf wholly upon her prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Kindneſs, 'tis evident ſhe would
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63944:61"/>
have prov'd his irreconcileable Enemy, and would have utterly excluded him from the King's Conſcience: and had he accepted the Confeſſorſhip as ſhe prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it for her ſelf, he had ſhut the Door againſt the Preferment he aim'd at; there being no likelyhood that the King would have choſen his Miſtreſs's Confeſſor for his own. Therefore he could not act more politickly, then to open his heart to her, and by that means win her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; at leaſt, we ſee that this way ſucceeded to his Wiſh. <hi>La Valliere,</hi> who would having given any thing to have had the King's Confeſſor her Friend, thought it no Prudence to refuſe one that came to offer his Service, and from whom ſhe might promiſe her ſelf all the Advantages ſhe could expect. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Female Favourite left nothing omitted to engage the King to diſmiſs his old Confeſſor, and in his room to make Choice of the Perſon whoſe Worth and Parts ſhe extoll'd to the utmoſt of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. This is a Man (ſaid ſhe) that will never ſit domineering over your Conſcience like a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was juſt aſſailing the King upon the weak ſide, who was wont to ſay, That he hated nothing ſo much as Reprimands Beſides all this, he had a great Eſteem for Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> and was quite weary of the other: ſo that finding no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy againſt the Perſon recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he promis'd <hi>La Valliere</hi> to diſmiſs his own Confeſſor upon the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Nor was it long before he met with one as favourable as he could deſire For the Old Man obſerving that the King one day, ſo ſoon as he came from the Communion, would hardly allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf time to Dine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but poſted away immediately to <hi>La Valliere,</hi> was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd at it, that never conſidering what would follow he waited till the King came to his Chamber, which was not till Four a Clock in the Morning. The King ſeeing him at ſuch an unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hour, with a ſurly Countenance, ask'd him, whom he look'd for? The Confeſſor anſwer'd. That he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God's Judgments againſt him, juſt ready to fall upon his Head; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd him with his Manner of Living
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63944:62"/>
in the moſt thund'ring Language imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, talking of nothing but Impiety, Sacrilege, Forſaking God, and Eternal Torments; concluding his Diſcourſe with telling him, That he was no longer able to ſee ſuch Irregularities; and therefore if he reſolv'd to continue his Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he deſir'd, for his part, that he might be diſmiſs'd. The King, who only waited for ſuch a Harangue as this, told him very ſmoothly, but withal very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he gave him leave to retire when he pleas'd, and that he would take care to provide himſelf a Confeſſor. At the ſame time he bid him Good-night, and commanded his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to draw the Curtains. The next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, becauſe he would not give the good Father time to repent, and get the Queen to mediate for him, which was the thing he moſt fear'd, the King ſent for <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> and told him before Monſieur and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> That his Confeſſor had begg'd leave to be diſmiſs'd; which he could not refuſe him,<note place="margin">1667.</note> becauſe indeed he was fitter for Contemplation, then to live in the Tumult and Hurry of a Court; and therefore finding no Eccleſiaſtick ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as himſelf, he would become his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63944:63"/>
and ſubmit the Conduct of his Conſcience to his Guidance. An Hour after, the King mighty jocund that his Game had play'd ſo well, went to <hi>La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere</hi>'s Chamber, to tell her the News, ſo afraid he was leſt any body elſe ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him — <hi>Oh, Par-bleau!</hi> — (ſaid he) As for the Prieſt, I took him at his Word; he did his own buſineſs himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God knows, I only took the Ball at the Rebound. <hi>La Valliere</hi> made anſwer, That 'twas the beſt way i' the world, provided the Queen did not marr all again: and this is that (added ſhe) which I very much fear. How! (ſaid the King) D'yee take me then to be a Man that is lead by the Noſe? Never deceive thy ſelf, my dear Girl, — 'Twas my Pleaſure; I have done it, and I will ſtand to it. Nothing pleaſes me more, then to make thoſe that are jealous of us, mad; and therefore to vex 'em worſe then I have done, I intend to keep Holy-day and Confeſs to Morrow. In a word, without any Preparation at all, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenc'd his Devotions the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the whole Court admiring the Violence of his Paſſion, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to which it tranſported him. In the mean time, the New-Confeſſor
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63944:63"/>
triumph'd, and every body began to make their Addreſſes to him; only Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Prince refrain'd, who naturally abominated Hypocrites. And indeed he told him one Day in the Queen's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſtrange things were to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from his Confeſſorſhip, who could prevail with the King to confeſs two Days together, that hardly went to Confeſſion twice in a Year before. The Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd no anſwer, becauſe that was no place for him to make Retorts in; but from that time forward he hated the Prince with ſuch a mortal Hatred, that he never ceas'd to work his Ruin, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him odious to the King.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as he ſaw himſelf inſtall'd, he made it his Buſineſs to ſecure himſelf againſt all unlucky Back-blows, which he had juſt Reaſon to fear; for he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Enemies: and to bring this to paſs he ſought to ſtrengthen himſelf by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Intereſts with thoſe that were in Favour.</p>
            <p>At that time the Count of <hi>Lauſun</hi> was the Man that ſhin'd in greateſt Luſtre at the Court. He was a Gentleman of that ſort, that there are not Ten thouſand ſuch in the Kingdom, who had not above Six thouſand a Year, paternal Eſtate. But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63944:64"/>
Fortune was ſo favourable to him, the from ſo ſmall a Pittance, he roſe in a little time to the Pinacle of Honour. He was Captain of the Guards of the Body, Collonel-General of Dragoons, and a Favourite excluſive. He has a great deal of Wit, and ſpeaks with the greateſt Grace in the World: Moreover, He is a Perſon of Worth, and fit for great Enterprizes, which he goes through with an extraordinary Proweſs. The Hiſtory of Him, and Mademoiſelle whom he marry'd privately in deſpite of the King and ſeveral other Paſſages, are Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials of this; and if we would one Day afford the World the Memorials of his Life, they would find therein many thing rare and ſingular. But his chiefeſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency lay in Courtſhip, wherein he gave way neither to <hi>Baſſompierre,</hi> nor St. <hi>Aignan.</hi> All the Ladies of the Court lov'd him, and ſome in a very particular manner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>La Valliere</hi> was not of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and in regard ſhe lov'd the King to the Heighth of Delicacy, and Niceneſs, the leaſt Kindneſs which he ſhew'd to any other Perſon whatever was a great Vexation to her. The Love which he had for the Count of <hi>Lauſun</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, made her Mad. You love him a

Prithee my little lovely Creature, reply'd the King, what would'ſt thou have me to do? Would'ſt have me drive him out of my Company, when he comes to wait upon me. Not ſo (ſaid <hi>La Valliere</hi>) I would only have yee not be always leaning upon his Shoulder; that he ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually whiſpering in your Ear; and that <hi>Lauſun</hi> ſhould not be the only Perſon that always never ſaid, or did any thing but what was curious and brave.

Merit and Charms of his Goddeſs; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, That he underſtood the Grandeur of the Conqueſt, but that he had not a Heart that durſt preſume to Love in the ſame place with his Prince.

            <p>Now though this Story was ſomething like to that of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought it not ſo proper to be <hi>Nathan.</hi>

There was no ſuch neceſſity for him to trouble himſelf much about the Buſineſs That Holy Man had always a Moral ready at a dead-lift, and Piſtol-proof againſt the moſt crying Adulteries. So that he ſubmitted with an Exemplary Reſignation to the Pleaſure of his King. More then that, he caus'd <hi>Lauſun</hi> to let <hi>Monteſpan</hi> know, and afterwards went himſelf to aſſure her of his invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Devotion to her Intereſts.

            <p>Poor <hi>La Valliere,</hi> who ſaw theſe things tranſacted before her Face, wept Day and Night, and made ſuch mournful Complaints, as would have mollify'd Stones.

and that Anſwer was made her, That he was gone: ſhe not being ſo ſatisfy'd, alighted out of her Coach, and would be let into the Convent. The Porter op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd her; and the Noiſe that ſhe made, fetch'd out ſeveral of the Jeſuits that ſtop'd her from going any farther. Then melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Tears, and abandoning her ſelf to all her Sorrows, ſhe thunder'd out a thouſand Exclamations againſt that Knave, who had been the firſt who confirm'd her in her Tenderneſs for the King; who had promis'd her a Thouſand times, that he ſhould never engage himſelf to any other; and yet notwithſtanding all his Promiſes, and his Fear of God, had baſely betray'd her, and had authoriz'd the King to commit an infamous Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and take another Man's Wife from him. In ſhort, In leſs then a Quarter of an Hour ſhe inform'd all thoſe that were preſent of all the ſecret Tranſactions that had paſs'd between her and him. The Jeſuits were ready to hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at this unlucky Accident, for which there was no Remedy. For ſhe was a Fury not to be approach'd but at the Peril of him that came within her reach. And if Mareſhal <hi>de Bellefonds</hi> had not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in the <hi>interim,</hi> and carry'd her away,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63944:70"/>
ſhe had moſt certainly reveal'd a great deal more, ſo much ſhe was beſide her ſelf.

However it were, ſhe betook her ſelf into a Carmelite Nunnery, where ſhe has continu'd ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Her Retirement deliver'd Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> from an extraordinary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance that extremely tormented him: for he made no queſtion but that in her Fury ſhe would have affronted him even in the King's Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monteſpan</hi> could not moderate her Joy, that now ſhe had no longer any Rivaleſs that could diſpute with her the Prince's Heart, and keep her from being ſole Predominant. <hi>Lauſun</hi> rid victorious over all his Enemies; and <hi>Louvois,</hi> content with his ſhare of her Favour, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>La Valliere.</hi> So that ſhe, a poor unfortunate Miſtreſs to a King, abandon'd and betray'd, ſaw her ſelf conſtrain'd to fly to a dreary Retirement, there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail, all the reſt of her days, thoſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Pleaſures which ſhe had hardly had

time to taſte; together with a Surpluſage of Grief, not to be lamented or pity'd but by very few.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Lauſun</hi> did not over-long enjoy the Pleaſure of Rejoycing at her Diſgrace. For in a little time after, he had the ill Luck to be cruſh'd by a Fall no leſs deſperate then her's. Every body knows how he had enthrall'd the Heart of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Montpenſier,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him for her Husband; and how the King, who thought himſelf engag'd by his Word to let him have whatever Miſtreſs he ſhould make Choice of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Match; which had been ſolemniz'd in the ſight of all the World, but that the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with ſeveral other Princes of the Blood, ſo well repreſented the Stain which that Marriage would imprint upon the Royal Family, that maugre the Importunities of <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nobility who ſided with <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun,</hi> he retracted his Word, and forbad 'em to think any more of it.</p>
            <p>But all the Prohibitions in the World were never able to with-hold two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of which the one was poſſeſs'd with a violent Love, the other by an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ambition; and He more-eſpecially,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63944:71"/>
ſince by the Match he became Related to one of the Greateſt Monarchs in <hi>Europe.</hi> He therefore Marry'd her Privately, without the King's Knowledge; flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, perhaps, That when the Thing was done, and that the King came to underſtand it, he would only look a little Gruff upon 'em for two or three Days. But he took a quite different Courſe: for though he lov'd 'em both very well, yet he would never conſent to let the Marriage be made Publick; and in regard there was ſome Reaſon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:63944:71"/>
hatching the Deſign of Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, hearken'd very much to the Councils of Father <hi>La Chaiſe;</hi> with whom Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> had left excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs upon that Subject, and who of himſelf prov'd greatly ſerviceable toward it, by means of the Jeſuits, People prepar'd for any Undertaking, and of whom he had always a hunder'd in his ſleeve ready to Obey all manner of Commands. The Draught of this Deſign which he had drawn up, look'd with as fair a Proſpect as any in the World. The King of <hi>England</hi> was to be lull'd a-ſleep, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt; which appear'd to be no difficult thing to do, provided you fed him with Money. Then was the King to fall upon <hi>Holland,</hi> and make himſelf Maſter of it. Which done, the Spaniſh <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the Biſhopricks of <hi>Liege, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> could not have made any long Reſiſtance. Then an Alliance was to be made with the Turk, to fall upon the Emperor on both ſides, and then divide the Spoils. Thus you ſee the Deſign was laid; and if it has not had that good Luck which was expected, it has not been for want of Conduct; for all the ſecret Tricks, and ſcandalous Artifiees of Knaviſh Policy, have been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63944:72"/>
made uſe of to bring it to paſs; except of latter Years, wherein I muſt confeſs they committed ſome Capital Faults which are never to be recover'd: Of which I ſhall ſpeak in due place.</p>
            <p>Now in regard the firſt ſtep they were to make in this great Enterprize, was, to make ſure of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1670.</note> the King reſolv'd to ſend thither his Siſter-in-Law, againſt the Advice of Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who had no Kindneſs at all for her; and who, as he ſaid, was not good Catholick enough to be entruſted with ſuch a Negotiation. However, ſhe ſet forward, and arriv'd at <hi>Dover;</hi> where ſhe was met by the King her Brother, to whom ſhe made thoſe Propoſals with which ſhe was entruſted; which were, To have an Alliance Offenſive and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive againſt all Princes; To break the Triple League; and, To make War upon <hi>Holland</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>But whether it were that the King had no Inclination to the Propoſitions of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or that the Princeſs not thinking they would be of any Advantage to him, diſſwaded him from medling, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd without doing any thing. Nor did Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> fail to lay hold of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63944:72"/>
Opportunity, to render her ſuſpected to the King, by putting him in mind, that he had told him what would come of it, before ſhe went. But whether it were that the King bore her any Grudge, or any other Perſon, ſhe dy'd at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Three, or Four Days after her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. God knows how, for we could never hear of any thing elſe, but that ſhe was very well in the Morning; only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſupt up a Meſs of Broth, ſhe cry'd out I am Poyſon'd. So dy'd that poor Princeſs in the Twenty ſixth Year of her Age, and Fifteen Days over.</p>
            <p>Now, though they were not ſo Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful the firſt time to involve the King of <hi>England</hi> wholly in their Intereſts, yet the Deſign was not given over. To which purpoſe Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> propos'd to the King to make uſe of the Jeſuits. 'Tis certain, Sir, (ſaid he) that they are the fitteſt Perſons in the World to manage both King <hi>Charles,</hi> and his Brother the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> For not to reck'n upon their being both Catholicks at the bottom of their Hearts, in regar'd they have been bred up in our Religion, Your Majeſty knows that they are deeply oblig'd to the Society. Had it not been for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Money which they furniſh'd 'em
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63944:73"/>
withal, they had been in danger of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but a ſmall Figure in the World. Our Fathers of <hi>France,</hi> alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, allow'd him Twenty thouſand Crowns a Year, which there is little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood will be ever re-pay'd 'em. I ſpeak this, (added he) to let your Majeſty know, that a Jeſuit will be no ominous ſight to that Prince. I believe it (reply'd the King) nor am I ignorant of the Kindneſſes he has receiv'd from your Society: So that there is good Reaſon to hope, that he will do much upon their Sollicitations. But with what an Eye d'you think will your Fathers be look'd upon in <hi>England?</hi> Do you believe they will be ſafe there? Never think it; and if they ſhould once come to be known there, the Character of Agent, or Envoy will never protect 'em from the Fury of the People. I ſhould rather chooſe to employ the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who has hitherto ſerv'd me faithfully in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral little Affairs, that I have entruſted to her Management; and I am perſuaded, ſhe will be no leſs uſeful to me in great Ones. She is very nimble, and dexterous in Buſineſs, and poſſeſſes altogether the very Heart and Soul of the King; and frankly to tell you a Miſtreſs has a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63944:73"/>
Opportunities, and Tricks, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Perſwaſion, which the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Miniſters can never meet with. Sir, (reply'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> with a Smile) your Majeſty may ſpeak knowingly in that particular: I have nothing to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I am alſo convinc'd, That the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> is now the only Perſon that can undertake this Affair with Succeſs. There needs no more then to inſtruct her well in your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Intentions, and 'tis only to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I have propos'd to ſend ſome of our People into that Country. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, (reply'd the King) I conſent to it, but whom ſhall we ſend? Your Majeſty, (anſwer'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>) cannot make choice of a better Man then Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>De Carnè.</hi> He is near of Kin to the Dutcheſs, and well-belov'd by the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and beſides that, he is one of the moſt Politick Head-pieces in our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The King agreed to it, and ſent him away Fifteen Days after, furniſh'd with Three or Four Suits of Modiſh Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, by way of Diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as he arriv'd at <hi>London,</hi> he went to wait upon the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who entertain'd him in a very courtly manner, for above a Quarter of an Hour,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63944:74"/>
not knowing who he was. However, ſhe bethought her ſelf that ſhe knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

'Tis true, that in my Youth, I lov'd my Pleaſures, perhaps a little more than became a Perſon of my Coat; but now I am become a Man that only ſeeks to ſerve God, and his Prince; and 'tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

He expects from you an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant piece of Service; and as I know you will be over-joy'd to have the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I ſhall not trouble you with long Remonſtrances, but only deliver his Letter into your Hands, together with another from the Reverend Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who has written to yee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: and I am to give yee notice, that you are beholding to him for the beſt part of the King's Reſolutions to make choice of your ſelf to ſerve him before his Embaſſador M. <hi>de Croiſſy,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer, who is wholly at his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Twenty others, who would have been glad to have given his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Proofs of their Fidelity to him. And ſo ſaying, he preſented the Letters to the Dutcheſs, who open'd 'em im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with a great deal of Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

So that when he came to be reſtor'd to his Crown, he begg'd her of the King of <hi>France</hi> and his Siſter, who could not deny him ſo ſmall a Favour. Preſently the King ſent a Yatch and a Frigate to <hi>Breſt,</hi> to bring her from thence into <hi>England.</hi> Where her Wit, and her Beauty, and her medling with State-Affairs, rais'd her a great number of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſome in the Parliament, ſome among the People, and others among the Court-Ladies, among whom there were few that equall'd her in Beauty. But for all this, the Love which ſhe had for the King, or her own Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which was the moſt likely, enabl'd her to ſurmount all theſe Difficulties with an extraordinary Courage. The chief Maxim of her Politicks, was to keep in with the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſide with <hi>France;</hi> and by that means ſhe ſo well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her Buſineſs, that ſhe held on a Ruling Favourite till the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, and ſhould I ſay, till the Advancement of King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> I ſhould not tell an Untruth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:63944:79"/>She is moderately Tall, well-Shap'd, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Air &amp; Gate of a Queen. She has the lovelieſt Mouth and Teeth in the world, and her Smiles penetrate to the bottom of the Heart. When ſhe has a mind to be Complaiſant, ſhe is altogether lovely; but the miſchief is, that ſhe will not be Complaiſant to All. And this is that which has procur'd her ſuch a world of Envy and Ill-will. She has a Wit ſo piercing, that 'tis impoſſible to diſguize any thing from her. Her prevailing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or rather her Idol, is Ambition; to which ſhe ſacrifices her Repoſe, her Pleaſures, her Honour, and all things in the World. Now in regard ſhe pants after nothing but Honour, and that for ſeveral Years ſhe has made a Conſiderable Figure in the World, ſhe has aſſum'd ſuch an Air of Grandeur and Buſineſs, which ſhe will never leave off as long as ſhe lives. There is no Woman living ſo Proud as this Woman: but the laſt Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> by which ſhe loſt above Fifty thouſand Crowns a Year, caus'd a great Alteration in her Affairs. However, ſhe put a good Face upon the Matter, in hopes the Times would change again, or elſe that the King of <hi>France</hi> would give her a Conſiderable Penſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63944:79"/>
for the Service ſhe did him. But that ſort of Gratitude is no longer in Faſhion: the Partridge muſt be plum'd while you have her in your Hands; for if once you let her go, 'tis in vain to expect ſhe will ever return. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> is a fair Example of this. She defy'd all <hi>England,</hi> to ſerve her French King and Countrey; and for that reaſon was thrown out of all. Since that, ſhe has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that neceſſity, as to ſell her Coaches, Horſes, Moveables, and to turn off three fourth Parts of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, no body offering her ſo much as a Penſion of a Thouſand Piſtoles. So that when all her Hopes fail'd her, and that there was no likelihood of King <hi>James</hi>'s Return, ſhe ſent her Son into <hi>England;</hi> where he became a Proteſtant, and marry'd the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi>'s Widow, with whom he had a great Fortune. By which means he is upon as ſure Grounds as before; and I think he has done very well.</p>
            <p>But leaving this Digreſſion, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was ſo over-joy'd that ſhe was become ſo neceſſarily Inſtrumental to the Deſigns of a Great Monarch, that in the Evening ſhe return'd this Anſwer to the King.</p>

            <p>In the mean time ſhe ſounded every day the King's Inclinations to the Propoſal ſhe had made him; and not finding him ſo averſe as ſhe thought he would have been, ſhe expected with Impatience an Opportunity to ſpeak to him in plain Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Nor was it long before ſhe met with one: for the King having demanded a Summ of Money of the Parlament, which they would not grant him, the King complain'd of this Refuſal, and told the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> That they us'd him like a Boy, whoſe Parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd

whether they were coming from a Bawdy-houſe, or going to one? and whether they were not the Perſons that they ſaw Dreſſing at ſuch a Surgeons. All this the King lik'd well enough. But when they came to ask the King how much Money the Parlament had given him to build his Palace? and where he intended to erect it? whether at <hi>London,</hi> or at <hi>Windſor?</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Impertinencies of the ſame nature, he could no longer contain his Paſſion. <hi>Par-bleu</hi> (ſaid he) Would any but an unhappy King, as I am, endure theſe Inſolencies? I could find in my heart to put 'em all to the Sword. Then the Dutcheſs put in ſeaſonably, and told him, That he was not to exert his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt thoſe pitiful Scoundrels, but againſt the Parlament, that were the Occaſion of all this, and who viſibly went about to keep him under Pupillage. She repeated the ſame thing to him when ſhe came home. At what time the King anſwer'd her, That 'twas true; and that he began to be ſenſible of it, and that he would take another Courſe. He told her farther, That he intended to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Parlament, and Call another that ſhould better underſtand their Duty.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63944:83"/>
Sir, (ſaid the Dutcheſs) Your Majeſty ſeems not to have rightly conſider'd the Greatneſs of the Evil, ſince you go about to apply ſuch Feeble Remedies. All <hi>England;</hi> of which the Parlament makes but one part, is animated with the ſame Spirit, that will prevail no leſs in another Parlament, when you have Call'd it, then in this. But you muſt go to the Bottom of the Miſchief, and pull it up by the Root, otherwiſe you do nothing. Afterwards, ſhe laid it before him, That ſo long as the Parlament found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſupported by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they would be ſtill playing the Maſters more and more, till they had confin'd his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within ſuch narrow Bounds, that when he would, it ſhould not be in his power to help himſelf. The King, who was then in the lucky Minute of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, jump'd with the Dutcheſs in her Sentiments, and told her, He was very much afraid it would come to that at length, and that he was very ſorry he did not heark'n to the Propoſals that were made him by the King of <hi>France.</hi> Certain it is (anſwer'd the Dutcheſs) that he is the Prince of the World whoſe Alliance would be moſt advantagious for your Majeſty. He loves you, and is much concern'd for your Honour. He is Potent, and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63944:83"/>
only Prince in a Condition to bring down and ſink the <hi>Hollanders</hi> into Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon whom you are to look as the only Obſtacles of your Majeſty's Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. The King gave ear to the Dutcheſs in ſuch a manner, as to make her think that he was no way diſpleas'd with her Diſcourſe. So that the Dutcheſs, after a great deal more to the ſame Tune, and ſtill finding he took all patiently, told him at length, That Father <hi>De Carnè,</hi> who was arriv'd in the Kingdom in the Quality of a Miſſionary, had declar'd to her, That the King his Maſter was extreme ſorry that his Majeſty would not (accept of his Alliance; That he foreſaw, to his great Grief, the unavoidable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which this Refuſal would draw upon him; and that the ſaid Father had Orders to engage her to ſpeak of it to his Majeſty; but that for fear of Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him ſhe had always kept her ſelf upon the Reſerve, though with a great deal of Reluctancy, becauſe ſhe knew the thing to be of great Importance. Upon that, the King, interrupting her, ask'd her where the Father was? telling her withal, That he ſhould be glad to ſee him. The next day ſhe ſent for him, and the King diſcours'd with him
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63944:84"/>
a long while. She alſo preſented him to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> who made very much of him, and promis'd to do his Utmoſt with the King. So that in ſhort, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> had leave to write to the King, That his Majeſty was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to negotiate with him a firm and good Alliance, ſo ſoon as he ſhould ſend any Perſon to that purpoſe. And the Treaty was concluded in the Lodgings belonging to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who had the greateſt ſhare in it. The Conditions were, That the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould defray the Expences of the Fleet, of which an Accompt ſhould be drawn up, and pay down Four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions before-hand. That for defraying the other Expences, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould begin the War, by ſetting upon the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet Homeward-bound, by which he would be a Gainer ſeveral Millions; and that at the ſame time the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould enter <hi>Holland</hi> at the Head of 100000 Men. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was put in Execution Point by Point; and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeeing the King was making great Preparations for the Sea, and not doubting but it would be againſt them, for that in all likelihood it could not be againſt <hi>France,</hi> yet could not fully
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63944:84"/>
perſwade themſelves of the truth, till they ſenſibly felt the Blow. They always thought that it tended either to get ſome Money out of 'em, or elſe to the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a thing which at that time was in Agitation among themſelves; ſo that without ever ſo much as ſtirring, they quietly expected the whole Force of their Enemies, which had like to have utterly over-whelm'd 'em. They then found it too true, That it is not ſufficient for a Prince to think himſelf ſafe, becauſe he has given no juſt occaſion of a War; and that he ought never to repoſe ſo profoundly upon the Faith of Treaties, as not to have Forces always ready to oppoſe his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon any ſudden breach of Peace; or according to the common Proverb, Not to relye ſo much upon a Neighbour, as not to keep a vigilant Eye over him. But go and preach theſe Politicks to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that love their Eaſe better then their Lives, and becauſe they have renounc'd enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Territories, think all others of their mind, and you may aswell preach to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Statues. In ſhort, this Confidence coſt 'em dear: For the King of <hi>England</hi> had no ſooner fallen upon the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet, but the King of <hi>France</hi> fill'd all <hi>Holland</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:63944:85"/>
with Terror, and Diſmay. He took <hi>Maeſtricht, Graves, Nimeghen,</hi> and pierc'd as far as <hi>Utretcht,</hi> from whence he beheld but one little ſpot more to Subjugate.<note place="margin">1672.</note> In that City he exercis'd all the Prerogatives of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Conqueror: He chang'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, coin'd Money, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſtately Embaſſie from <hi>England;</hi> at what time the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Arlington,</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> were ſent from the King of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe things tickl'd <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> even to Triumph, and Exultation, inſomuch that he could not forbear asking the King, with an Air of Joy, and Content, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would take his Counſel another time.</p>
            <p>He had alſo Emiſſaries in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Courts, more-eſpecially with the Emperor, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> into whoſe Ears they continually peal'd, That the King had no other Aim in this War, but the Extirpation of Hereſie, which he was going to Attack and Combat even in the Trenches, and in the very Arms of her moſt formidable Champions, the Engliſh, and Hollanders; that by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Favour of God, there was a Way found to diſ-unite 'em, and that they
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63944:85"/>
would themſelves deſtroy one another: and that the Finger of God, and that Celeſtial Frenzy which conſtrain'd the Enemies of the People of God to fall upon one another was herein to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The Emperor, who is a good Prince, and a zealous Catholick, ſeriouſly believ'd the Tales which the Jeſuits told him, and making it a Caſe of Conſcience to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch Holy Arms, remain'd in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy that ſurpriz'd all the World, and warm'd himſelf at the Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd his Nighbours Houſe, never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Danger of his own.</p>
            <p>At length the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> a wiſe, and couragious Prince, could no longer be a Spectator in a Quarrel that ſo nearly concern'd him. He was the firſt that drew his Sword to ſuccour poor <hi>Holland,</hi> then at the laſt Gaſp; and ſo lively laid before the Emperor the terrible Conſequences of the King's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, that he oblig'd him to declare open War, and to ſend a good Army to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi> with Orders to join the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and fight <hi>Turenne,</hi> after he had well tyr'd his Army; which would have extreamly weak'nd the King's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63944:86"/>
and reduc'd him to a Neceſſity of quitting his Conqueſts to defend his own Country. This unexpected Reſolution of the Emperor, extreamly incumber'd him; for <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had always promis'd the contrary; nor was it a ſmall Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Diſappointment to the King. But <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> bid him be of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for that he had an infallible Secret to make him break up the Campaign without fighting a ſtroak; as he did, by Counterfeiting a private Order from the Emperor to <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> which forbid him poſitively to join the Elector, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Commands he had receiv'd to the contrary, unleſs they imported an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and particular Revocation of the Order he had ſent him. And thus the Buſineſs was carried on.</p>
            <p>During the time that <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> reſided at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had for his Companion a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Italian Fryer, whoſe Name was <hi>Franciſco Pironni,</hi> a Graver once, and an Ingenious Artiſt in his Trade, but withal, the greateſt Cheat, and Rogue, that ever the Earth bore. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had made uſe of this Fellow upon ſundry Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherein he ſhew'd ſuch Proofs of his Ability, and Induſtry, that he thought him able to gain him many Creatures
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63944:86"/>
among the Jeſuits in <hi>Germany,</hi> whether he ſent him only upon that Deſign. <hi>Pironni</hi> diſcharg'd his Truſt ſo effectually, that by means of his Intriegues, <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had ſettl'd his beſt Correſpondencies at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and it was to himſelf that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to counterfeit the Order which I have mention'd. They had found a way to put into his Hands ſome old Pattent, where was both his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Sign Manual, and his Seal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd; and both the one and the other were counterfeited ſo exactly well, that the Emperor himſelf would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. So that <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd his Indignation by his repeated Refuſals to join the Electoral Army, was abſolutely juſtified by ſhewing his counterfeit Orders. This Villain had grav'd the Seal upon a Steel of the ſame Bigneſs, and cut the Sign Manual upon a Copper-Plate; which being apply'd to the Paper, made the Impreſſion ſo exact, that it was impoſſible to diſcover the Cheat, though it had been known before-hand. This being done, and the Order written above the Sign Manual, a Courier's Habit was procur'd for <hi>Pironni,</hi> and he carry'd it himſelf to the General, and then return'd to his Convent, where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63944:87"/>
it was not to be thought that any body would look for him. And this was the Reaſon that the Imperial Arms had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Succeſs that Year: And had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> been ſo prudent, as young as he was, inſtead of ceaſing to beſiege Twenty Towns one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to march directly to <hi>Bon,</hi> which he took, and open'd the Paſs of <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Germans, whom he put into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make a powerful Diverſion, we had the greateſt Reaſon to expect, that all the Remainder of the Seven Provinces would have fallen into the Hands of the French. But this Courſe which the Prince took, broke all their Meaſures in ſuch a manner, that they were forc'd to abandon all, except <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and <hi>Graves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it ſeldom happens that one Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune comes alone, it ſo fell out, that the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> beholding this turn of Fortune, took courage, and preſented ſo many ſeveral Addreſſes to the King, that he was forc'd to make a Peace with the Dutch whether he would or no. However, he wrote firſt of all to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to let him know, that he could not avoid concluding the Peace, by reaſon of the Importunitie of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63944:87"/>
his Subjects. I could produce ſeveral Copies of the Letters written upon this occaſion; but becauſe I would not be Prolix, this ſhall ſuffice from the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> to Father <hi>La Chaiſe.</hi>

                  <p>'TIS but ſome few Days agoe, That the King of <hi>England</hi> was conſtrain'd to Sign a Peace full ſore againſt his Will. I cannot tell what his Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> may think of it, but I cannot forbear telling you, That in truth, he has no Reaſon to take it Ill, conſidering how long it was before he came to a final Reſolution. He ſtav'd it off to the very laſt; and without doubt, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſented, had he not had certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> finding <hi>Holland</hi> free and quitted, began to liſten to the Propoſals of the Parlament, who, as your Reverence knows, had invited him into the Kingdom. We were perſwaded till now, That his youthful Years, which ſeem'd not to be ripe for great Enterprizes, together with his natural moderation, and averſeneſs to Broils, and Quarrels, would not have permitted him to give ear on that ſide; but ſince we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That if he were not fully reſolv'd, yet his Wavering was enough to continue the King's
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63944:88"/>
Jealouſies, and that the States did no way diſapprove his making a Deſcent, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would be the moſt advantagious Courſe they could take.</p>
                  <p>The News therefore of his Heſitation, put the King of <hi>England</hi> upon coming to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Determination, who could not in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence venture the Invading of his Kingdom by the only Enemy that he had moſt reaſon to fear. A Revolution like that, would have engag'd the King to a Diverſion that muſt have been much to his Prejudice, whereas now he may interpoſe, as a Mediator, and procure his Majeſty an advantagious Peace if he thinks it convenient; or if not, he may be in a condition to do him all poſſible Services under-hand; and of this your Reverence may aſſure his Majeſty.

Afterwards he fought that famous Battel of <hi>Seneff,</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> whom he had challeng'd to a fair Field for Fifteen Days together; while <hi>Condè,</hi> ſomewhat Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in number, kept himſelf within his Trenches, till at length the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſeeing it was impoſſible to follow him, Decamp'd. <hi>Condè,</hi> who well knew that the ways were very narrow through which he was to paſs, let him go till he thought his Van-guard, and main Body were out of reach, and then came out of his Hole, fell upon the Rear-guard, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63944:89"/>
utterly defeated it; and had he been ſo much Maſter of himſelf to have ſtopt there, the Honour of the Victory had been ſolely his. But he had too long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that martial Heat that importun'd him to be doing; and as a Torrent ſtopt for a few Days by ſome certain Mound, becomes more terrible, and violent when once it makes way; ſo <hi>Condè</hi>'s Warlike Ardour, that had been bounded by his Prudence for Fifteen Days, was no ſooner at Liberty, but bearing now predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Sway, it made him loſe the greateſt part of the Advantage which he had won before: For having paſs'd the narrow Lanes, and being got into the Plain, he found the whole Dutch Army drawn up in good order, which receiv'd him ſo co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63944:89"/>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1676"/> Toward the end of the Year 1676. the Commiſſioners met at <hi>Nimeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,</hi> to negotiate the Treaty of Peace. Thither came the Plenipotentiaries from the Emperor, from the Electors, from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> from <hi>Hanover,</hi> from <hi>Sweden,</hi> from <hi>Danemark,</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was Mediatrix, which made one of the moſt noble Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies that had been known. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, whole Years were ſpent in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Preliminaries, all which time the War was carry'd on vigorouſly, and always to the King's Advantage.

            </p>
            <p>This proſperous Succeſs alarm'd the Parlament of <hi>England,</hi> and forc'd 'em to deſire his Brittanick Majeſty to enter into a War; and that with ſo much Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as gave him to underſtand that he muſt reſolve upon it. To that purpoſe they preſented Two Addreſſes to him, laying before him the Neceſſity of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

ſuch a Torrent of Victory, more eſpecially in <hi>Flanders;</hi> beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to make an offenſive League with the Hollanders.<note place="margin">1677.</note> Theſe Importunities very much diſpleas'd the King, who fear'd nothing ſo much as that he ſhould be conſtrain'd to it. But at laſt, the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with his Niece being conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there was a Neceſſity for him to make a fair ſhew, the beſt he could; ſo that after long Conferences with him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Peace, he conſented to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of his Parlament and promis'd to declare War againſt <hi>France,</hi> if ſhe ſtood too high upon her Terms. Thereupon, Commiſſions were given out for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of 20000 Men; and Soldiers came in ſo faſt, that in Six Weeks the Levies were compleat: ſo eager were the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for a War with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> gave a punctual Account of all things to Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who not knowing what other Remedy to apply, told the King, That now was the time if ever, to ſet his Exchequer at work,<note place="margin">1678.</note> in regard his dazling Louidores had a ſtrange O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration upon the King of <hi>England.</hi> The
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63944:90"/>
Dutcheſs therefore had her part given her, ſmartly to lay before the King the Reaſons that with-held him from declaring War againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> his good Friend, and his only Friend that could ſtand by him in a caſe of Neceſſity: That it was but a bad piece of Policy to break abſolutely with him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his repeated Promiſes, meerly to comply with his Parliament that was in no condition to hurt him: That he was going the way to ruin all that he had been labouring with ſo much Trouble, for ſo many Years, for his own, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Religion, not conſidering the Honour he would loſe of being a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and Umpire of one of the moſt Important Wars that had been known of a long time, and leave that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſome petty Prince, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he would be afterwards oblig'd to ſue for under-hand.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs alſo had Orders, when ſhe had ſaid as much as ſhe could ſay, to offer him Twelve Millions, to give the more weight, and Force to her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>Now in regard this Contrivance was well lay'd, it had its Effect: The King ſuffer'd himſelf to be perſwaded, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63944:91"/>
told the Dutcheſs withal, that ſhe was the only Woman of the World that had the right Notion of things, and ſpoke the moſt to the purpoſe in whatever ſhe diſcours'd upon. And now the Deſign of the War was to be quite broken off whatever it coſt; and the way to bring it about was to gain ſome Members of the Lower-Houſe, who, when the King deſir'd Money for the Payment of his Men, propos'd that there might be none granted him, till he had given 'em Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about the Affairs of Religion. The King made a ſhew of being very much incens'd at this Reſolution, then which there could be nothing more welcome to his Soul, in regard it was the faireſt Pretence in the World that he could make uſe of, to put off his making Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Add to this, That the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was afraid, leaſt the King ſhould be conſtrain'd to enter into a War againſt him whether he would or no, as it was very probable,<note place="margin">1679.</note> conſidering that he could not avoid making an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Treaty with the Dutch reſolv'd to conclude a particular Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> not queſtioning but that when <hi>Holland</hi> was once ſeparated from

the League, the reſt would be eaſily brought to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>By this Treaty the King oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reſtore Six Places in <hi>Flanders</hi> to the Spaniards, and to quit 'em within Fourteen Days after it was Sign'd. The Emperor and the Confederates loudly complain'd of <hi>Holland,</hi> for quitting 'em in that manner, they who had enter'd into the War, meerly in Reſpect to her, and for her ſake. Which oblig'd the King of <hi>France</hi> to ſend <hi>Luxemberg</hi> before <hi>Mons</hi> to frighten the States, and hinder 'em from altering their Reſolutions. And at the ſame time he gave 'em to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That he would not quit the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before they had engag'd the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to give Satisfaction to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> his Confederate. But that was no more then a falſe foin to procure the Peace with more Security. For when the Day came that he was to abandon the Places, the King's Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors told thoſe of the States, that they would conſent to it. So that the Embaſſadors not having time to write, either to the Provinces, or the States for new Inſtructions, preferr'd Peace in that preſſing Conjuncture, be-, fore War. For the King's Miniſters
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63944:92"/>
gave 'em no more then a Days time to determine. After which, they declar'd, They would retire, and enter no farther into any Negotiation.</p>
            <p>The Peace, then, was concluded, and the Six Places in purſuance of it, were quitted, according to Agreement. The League being thus divided, all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates were oblig'd to come to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by themſelves, and every body made the beſt of their Market which was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably cheap. Only the poor Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who had ſo generouſly thruſt himſelf into the War, was the laſt, and left alone to bear the whole weight of the King's Arms. But in regard there was no equality between the Parties, he was glad to treat likewiſe, and to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Swede all that he had taken from him.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the War that had been kindl'd, and fomented by the Inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Father <hi>La Chaiſe;</hi> who no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw <hi>Europe</hi> in Tranquility on that ſide, but he labour'd to the utmoſt of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to diſturb the Repoſe of it in another part. So true it is, that this buſie <hi>Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feu</hi> finds no reſt, but in the ruin of other Mens Quiet; no Pleaſures, but in their Calamities. Never was he ſo jocund,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63944:92"/>
and blithe, as when he had kindl'd a Flame in all the Four Corners of the World, and could ſay to himſelf, <hi>Hoc eſt Opus Meum:</hi> "This is my Work. This being then the Humour of the Man, we muſt not wonder at the Misfortunes, and Diviſions that have hitherto Reign'd in the ſeveral States of <hi>Europe,</hi> and which we muſt expect will never be at an end ſo long as he lives.</p>
            <p>Till the Year 1673. he confin'd his Diſturbances of Soveraign States to the Perſecutions of the Huguenots, the Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts, and ſeveral other Perſons of Worth, and Honour. But theſe petty Crimes not appearing Glorious enough for an ungracious Wretch ſo ſignally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd as himſelf, he reſolv'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Holy Father, and the Church it ſelf: as being reſolv'd to make 'em ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, That he was deſtin'd to be the Plague of Mankind.</p>
            <p>I omit for this time, the black Attempts, and Tragical Revolutions which he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in his mind, from that time forward, and which blaz'd out a little after: I ſhall ſpeak of 'em in their Order. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Series of time engages me to ſay ſomething of the Regale, which he erected at length upon the Ruine of ſo
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63944:93"/>
many fair and ancient Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being mov'd in the leaſt at the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Misfortunes which it trail'd after it. But how ſhould ſuch things move him, who made thoſe Misfortunes the only Mark at which he aim'd.</p>
            <p>The Regale is the Right which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have of nominating to vacant Benefices, and to enjoy the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of 'em, during their vacancy. 'Tis pretended, That this Right is grounded upon Cuſtome; and that in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> made choice of their Biſhops at their own Pleaſure. But however it were, this is certain, That the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſle,</hi> from whence the Pragmatic Sanction was drawn, otherwiſe ordain'd the manner of providing for 'em, and decreed, That for the time to come, the Clergy, and the People ſhould elect their Paſtors, and their Biſhops, and that they ſhould be alſo Conſecrated and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by the Metropolitan, and the reſt of the Biſhops of the Eccleſiaſtical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, without having any need of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome:</hi> after which they ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Inferiour Benefices within the Extent of their Dioceſs, or Pariſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:63944:93"/>Now in regard this Pragmatic was equally burdenſome, as well to the Popes, as Kings, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> X. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. made an Agreement together, That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to Benefices, and the diſpoſal of the Revenues during their Vacancy, ſhould belong to the Crown; and that all Lapſes, Anticipations, and the Right of Admitting Reſignations ſhould be in the Power of the Pope: ſo that to ſpeak the naked. Truth, they ſhar'd between 'em the Spoils of the poor Church of God. This, in ſhort, is the Original and Extent of this Prerogative; which went no farther then the Lands, and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were under the French Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, at the time of the Agreement. For ſince that time, ſeveral have fall'n to the Crown that were not ſubject to it, no more then are certain Congregations, as that of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,</hi> &amp;c. The General Council of <hi>Lion</hi> alſo, has made a Deciſion upon this Point; and being deſirous to prevent Abuſes that might follow, forbad the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Regale into ſuch Churches where it was not in uſe. And the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Churches have been ſince acknowledg'd, and confirm'd by ſeveral Ordinances, Decrees, and Declarations
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63944:94"/>
of <hi>Philip the Fair, Philip de Valeis, Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> XII. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. which are preſerv'd in the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts in <hi>Paris.</hi> However, in regard it is one of the moſt beautiful Flowers of the Crown, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was the Firſt who laid the Foundation of that Grandeur to which it is now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, comprehended, among the reſt of his Projects, the Extending it over all the Monarchy. In ſhort, in the Year 1637. he began to ſet a-foot, by the King's Counſel, the general Conteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Regale; at what time there was a Decree of the 6th. of <hi>October,</hi> Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Biſhops, and Archbiſhops that pretended to be exempt from the Right of the Regale, to ſend to the Regiſtry of the Council, the Titles upon which they claim'd their Privilege; and which gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſurceaſing of Proceſſes, ſu'd out, or to be ſu'd forth upon that Occaſion. The Syndics of the Provinces of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc, Guienne, Provence,</hi> and <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> preſently obey'd the Order: Proteſting, Nevertheleſs, That by that Proceeding they did not go about to prejudice the Liberties of thoſe Provinces, which were not oblig'd to produce any Evidences, provided they were not the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63944:94"/>
of Privileges, or Immunities gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Kings, but of Liberties, and Franchiſes more ancient then the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy it ſelf, in Poſſeſſion of which, their Anceſtors came under the French Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, only that what they did was to ſhew their ready Obedience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Majeſty. This Affair, tho' it was not altogether neglected, yet lay in a manner dormant, till the Year 1673. that Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> the Author of all the Misfortunes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King's Head to move this Stone, under which there lay a moſt venemous Serpent. But in regard this Matchiavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt underſtands, that the moſt certain way to pleaſe Princes, is to procure 'em tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantages, he never minds at what rate they are to be purchas'd. Beſides, he was afraid leaſt the War wherein he had engag'd his Majeſty ſhould Miſcarry, and therefore ſought which way to render himſelf neceſſary to the King, upon ſome other Score, thereby to prevent the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that threaten'd him.</p>
            <p>At this time it was then, that the King finiſh'd the general Claim by a Decree in <hi>Fbruary,</hi> Importing, That the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the Right of the Regale to be Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienable, and without the compaſs of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63944:95"/>
and to belong univerſally to him, in all the Biſhopricks, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks of his Kingdom, Territories, and Countries under his Obedience, thoſe only excepted which are exempt by <hi>Titre Onereux;</hi> that is to ſay, by being lyable to particular Duties, and charges of Fines, Annuities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In purſuance of which, His Majeſty Ordains, That the Biſhops, and Archbiſhops, ſhall be Bound in Two Months, from the Day that they take their Oaths of Fidelity, to take out Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Pattents of Diſcharge, and to Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter 'em in the Chamber of Accompts of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that they who have taken their Oaths of Fidelity before, and have not obtain'd their Letters Pattents of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, ſhall be bound to take 'em out, and Regiſter 'em within Two Months in the ſaid Chamber of Accompts; after which, and for defect of yielding Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within that time, their Benefices ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Right of the Regale, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon Royal Collations ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd void, and ſubject to a new Grant by virtue of the Regale.</p>
            <p>And by another Declaration in the ſame Month of <hi>February,</hi> the King in order to the Execution of the preceding Decree, Authoriſes a Roll, containing a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63944:95"/>
Regulation of the Fees which ſhall be pay'd into the Chamber of Accompts by the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops of the Provinces of <hi>Languedoc, Dauphinate, Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Province,</hi> for the Regiſtring the Letters of Diſcharge, which they ſhall be bound to take forth.</p>
            <p>This Declaration, which was procur'd by the pernicious Counſells of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, was the Apple of Diſcord which divided all the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, out of which have flown all the Miſchiefs that have over-whelm'd in a manner, all <hi>Europe,</hi> for near theſe Twenty Years A Work truly worthy the Author of it, and which he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without queſtion, with the ſame Eye as <hi>Nero</hi> formerly beheld the Flame which he himſelf had kindl'd to conſume the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Court-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and Biſhops, People devoted to Ambition, and their Pleaſures, obey'd without Murmuring; and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Pattents of Releaſe, which they were order'd to take out, caus'd 'em to be Regiſter'd with their Oaths of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. But others, and among the reſt, the Biſhops of <hi>Cahors, Aleth,</hi> and <hi>Pamiers,</hi> greatly ſignaliz'd themſelves in refuſing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63944:96"/>
to ſubmit, conſidering that their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would be a tacit Conſent to the King's Pretenſions, or rather of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who were altogether unjuſt. Thereupon, the Court ſent to every one of thoſe Biſhops certain Eccleſiaſticks, preferr'd, by virtue of the Regale, to ſome Benefices in their Cathedrals, which were poſſeſs'd by others in Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Poſſeſſion for ſeveral Years by lawful Titles, and upon the refuſal of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to admit 'em, order'd 'em to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd by force. Theſe manifeſt Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions oblig'd thoſe worthy Prelates, the Latter of which Two was 70 Years of Age, and had been Biſhops, the one 38, the other 34 Years, during which time they had render'd themſelves vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for their Exemplary Piety, and a Reſidence in their Dioceſſes ſo aſſiduous, that they were never ſeen to appear at Court; theſe Intruſions, I ſay, enforc'd thoſe Prelates to iſſue forth Ordinances againſt the newly preſerr'd; and after that, to write ſeveral reitterated Letters to the King, Cardinal <hi>Bonſi,</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> They alſo wrote to the Aſſembly of the Clergy, which met in 1675. but there was no Favour to be ſhewn 'em, and the Clergy rejected their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63944:96"/>
Complaints, not vouchſafing ſo much as to take Cognizance of the Affair: Nor was it poſſible they ſhould expect any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in regard the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe Intereſts, and Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s, were inſeparably link'd together, preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Aſſembly, and for that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bonſi,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and by Conſequence, the principal Perſon concern'd, was gain'd to all Intents and Purpoſes, and the Biſhops of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and <hi>Beziers,</hi> were Commiſſioners from that Province. So that word was ſent to the Diſſenting Prelates, that the Affair having been decided in the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, where the Clergy's Agents were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and conſenting, it was in vain to make any Oppoſition. As if the Agents had had ſufficient Power to diſannull by their Authority, the ſacred Rights of ſo many ancient Churches.</p>
            <p>Toward the end of the ſame Year, the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers</hi> was forc'd to make a Journey to Court, for the diſpatch of ſome Buſineſs which he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence withal,<note place="margin">1675.</note> and the Dignity of Archdeacon of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church being vacant by the Death of the laſt Incumbent: Father <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> who had notice of it, having a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63944:97"/>
to ſurprize the Biſhop, propos'd to him to procure him Letters of Diſpatch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in favour of a Prieſt, whom he lov'd very well, and upon whom he made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the choice would fall. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd likewiſe to expedite the ſame Grants for other Beneficiaries of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had not as yet obtain'd 'em, to which the good Biſhop immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; but afterwards conſidering the Conſequences that would enſue, and the Engagement which he laid upon his Church, he fearleſly retracted his word, and ſent the Father word, That he could not comply with his Deſires. This was cauſe ſufficient for that Hypocrite to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Biſhop even to Rage, and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He peal'd it in the King's Ears, That he was a Rebel, a Seditious Incendiary, who aim'd at nothing but to ſtir up the Clergy, and all his Subjects to Revolt: So that notwithſtanding all his Oaths of Allegiance, all his Proteſtations, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to the King, he always look'd upon him as a diſaffected Perſon.</p>
            <p>But whatever Credit <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had in the Aſſembly of the Clergy, when the King's Prerogatives were in Diſpute, for the upholding of which he ſpoke with great freedom, nevertheleſs he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

reverenc'd the Holy Church, and the Holy See, that now you go about to deſtroy what both have eſtabliſh'd; and if it be true, as ſome give cut, not only without Authority, but againſt the King's Conſent. For 'tis obſerv'd, That in the laſt Brevets which you have got diſpatch'd for the Canonſhips of my Cathedral, that the Clauſe formerly inſerted at the beginning, which binds the Perſons preferr'd, to take upon 'em the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, or to admit themſelves Noviciates, is left out, and that Expedients are alſo found out to exempt thoſe who were bound to thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by their Brevets. There are alſo ſeveral Intelligent Perſons, and your good Friends, who attribute this Conduct of yours to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſecuralize my Church, notwithſtanding Mine, and the Oppoſition of my Chapter, and without any Authority from the Pope. Is this the acquittal of the Promiſe you made me, as well for thoſe whom you have engag'd in thoſe Benefices, as to ſome Eccleſiaſticks of my Dioceſs? Think you the Publick does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how you abuſe that Belief which your Quality of Confeſſor fixes in the King's Mind; not only in cauſing him unknowingly to violate the Rights of the Church, but alſo to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize in his Name, thoſe pieces of Injuſtice, which would hardly be believ'd, did they not appear in open Acts of Violence. 'Tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Reverend Father, that you ſhould have

Now if you are not fully acquainted with this Matter, How is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for yee to be ſo confidently Inſtrumental to our being handled upon this Occaſion with the ſame Rigour, as if we were Enemies of the Church, and State.

Believe me, Dear Father, for as I have the Honour to be a Biſhop, I have the Privilege to give yee good Advice; You have reaſon to fear incurring not only the Indignation of God, in violating the Indignation of his Spouſe, but alſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the King, who is too quick-ſighted not to come to the Knowledge one Day of theſe Things; and too juſt, not to condemn the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Actions to which your Counſels have bow'd him contrary to his Inclinations.

of the Concordat:</hi> Wherein he made out a very ſpecious Right of Nomination to ſeveral Benefices. The King had alſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commiſſioners to examine it; but what avail'd all this to a Perſon whom <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> hated. He was forbid to print his Book, and that was all the Reward he had for his Pains, to have labour'd a long time to no purpoſe, and perhaps againſt his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Nor were they the Churches only endow'd with Benefices which <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> reſolv'd to Subjugate under the Yoak of the Regale, but the Monaſteries of the Urbaniſt Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who ever ſince their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, had been Priories Elective only from Three Years, to Three Years. The whole Congregation of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> among the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines, under-went the ſame Fate. The Abbot of <hi>Clugni,</hi> who had been Canonically elected, was expell'd, and the Monks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd to receive the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who took poſſeſſion of it. By virtue of the ſame Prerogative, the Abbies of <hi>Chezal-Benoiſt,</hi> which had been united to that Congregation by the Authority of the Holy See, and the Grants of ſeveral Kings, had every one a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Abbot impos'd upon 'em, as had alſo a Thouſand others, too tedious here to be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

and many times moſt horrid Violences, and Sacrileges.</p>
            <p>Theſe Exorbitances, at length, reach'd the Holy Father's Ears, by the Complaints of the Monks and Nuns, at the ſame time that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> and <hi>Aleth,</hi> made the ſame Lamentations. And it griev'd him beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to ſee, That a moſt Chriſtian King pre-poſſeſs'd by an impious Varlet of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus, as he ſtiles himſelf, ſhould yet the Church with Perſecutions ſo cruel, and till then unheard of under the Reign of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Prince. He wrote therefore to the King ſeveral Briefs, and laid before him with an Affection altogether cordial and paternal, the Injuſtice wherein he had unwarily engag'd himſelf by the Counſells of his Miniſters, and particularly of Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who had giv'n him an <hi>Idea</hi> of Things contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Equity.

He alſo wrote to the Cardinals <hi>Bonzi,</hi> and <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Father <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> which wrought no other Effect, but only that it procur'd the ſending of <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> Who to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his Holineſs to ſwallow patiently this bitter Cup, ſet forward in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1680.</p>

               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:63944:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Clergy, who were then aſſembl'd, had receiv'd a large Brief from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the ſame Subject, to which all the anſwer they gave was this, that they wrote a Letter to the King, wherein they told him, that the Pope took upon him to concern himſelf in a buſineſs which they could by no means approve, in regard that inſtead of ſubmitting to the common good of the Church, he only gave people an opportunity to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal together, to encreaſe Confuſion and Schiſm, and to encourage and embolden ſeditious ſpirits, the conſequences of which would be very pernitious.</p>

During his ſickneſs, he wrote three Letters; one to the Pope, deſiring his Prayers and his Protection of the Church, which moſt aſſuredly after his death would be ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Regale; another to the King, to aſcertain him, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taken the liberty to oppoſe his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Decrees, but to ſatisfie the duty of his Function, and the Character he wore, which oblig'd him indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to defend the intereſts of the Church, which had been depoſited i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">IV. <hi>And laſtly, that the Pope is not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, neither in Fact, nor of Right, unleſs he preſide at the Head of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and Oecumenic Council, which decides and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Pope infallible, by authorizing that infallibility which otherwiſe would never be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Clergy ſent other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the King, beſeeching him to order that this Doctrine ſhould be taught in all Colleges and Univerſities, and that the Decree might be regiſter'd in Parliament, which was granted by an Authentick Declaration of the Kings, importing very ſevere prohibitions to all Profeſſors, Doctors, Readers in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and Preachers to teach any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine oppoſite to it, and it was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd in the Univerſities.</p>
            <p>There were many worthy Eccleſiaſticks that would not admit of this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; who for that reaſon were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63944:106"/>
baniſh'd and diſpoil'd of their Benefices and Eſtates. So that there were two great perſecutions in <hi>France</hi> at one time; one againſt the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and the other againſt the Popelings the one againſt Hereticks, the other againſt the Orthodox. The way to live at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was then to be as a man my ſay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fleſh nor Fiſh; the rigid Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks being then equally odious and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. Thus was the poor Church op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the Jeſuits, the real Tyrants over <hi>France;</hi> and ſo much the more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, becauſe ſhe was not permitted the liberty to complain: the Perſecutors boaſting all this while of the mighty things which they did for her. But what ſignifi'd all their zeal for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Hereſie, ſeeing they ſet up another Hereſie at the ſame time? Was not this to bind up the Wounds of the Church with one hand, and Stabb a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to her Heart with the other?</p>
            <p>The Holy Father, having perus'd this Determination of the Clergy, was griev'd to the Soul, and ſent ſeveral Briefs to the aſſembled Clergy, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade 'em to recant, of which they took very little or no notice.

            <p>Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> however was not ſo taken up with the Affairs of the Regale, but that he had a hand in ſeveral other concerns. More eſpecially, that of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> he made his buſineſs, and ever ſince his being Confeſſor, he has bent all his endeavours to deſtroy 'em without mercy. However in this reſpect, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that he was truly mov'd by the Kings intereſts; for it is viſible, that he impoveriſh'd the Kingdom, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd his Enemies with Soldiers, fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an inteſtine War; and laſtly, rais'd an obſtruction not to be ſurmounted, to impede the great deſign of the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liberty of <hi>Europe.</hi> I ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63944:109"/>
be rather inclin'd to think, that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> being without queſtion the moſt formidable Enemies the Jeſuits have, they would fain, at any rate, be rid of theſe troubleſome Overſeers, who pry ſo narrowly into 'em, and never let 'em be at reſt, either as to their Morals or their other Irregularities. However it be, this is moſt certain, that thoſe moſt unfortunate people are to look upon him as the Author of all their miſeries. It was he, who together with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Louvois,</hi> and others of the ſame Gang, ſet forth thoſe terrible Declarations that appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from the year 1679, to 1685, and which were the Preliminaries to their total ruin: for all this ended in that fatal blow which they ſo much fear'd, that is to ſay, the Revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> which was annull'd the 18th of <hi>October</hi> 1685.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> two years before, had found a much ſhorter way to exterminate 'em; and to which, by an Enchantment not to be imagin'd, he had obtain'd the King's conſent; from whom he had extorted an expreſs Order for the Maſſacre of all thoſe of that Religion: and thus the thing was to have been put
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63944:109"/>
in execution. There was an Order for the marching of four or five Regiments, and diſperſing 'em into thoſe places where the <hi>Huguenots</hi> liv'd, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of keeping them within the bounds of their duty. After which, Orders for the Maſſacre were to be ſent to all the Biſhops, who were to have caus'd the Soldiers to have been drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a certain day appointed, which was to have been the ſame over all parts of <hi>France,</hi> and after they had made a Speech to 'em, to encourage 'em againſt Hereticks, they were to have ſignifi'd the Kings pleaſure to 'em, and at the ſame time to have deliver'd the King's Letters ſeal'd with his Signet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. But Monſieur the Prince, who was a man of Honour, and beſides, had a greater love for the Soldiers then to ſuffer 'em to embrue their hands in ſo deteſtable an Action, prevented the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that Enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>I have already ſet forth, how <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> had always oppos'd him ever ſince his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Confeſſor, and of the League that M. <hi>de Louvois</hi> and the Father had enter'd into, to remove him from the publick management of Affairs. They had left nothing unattempted during
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63944:110"/>
the Life of the Prince, and they beheld with an extraordinary jealouſie the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he had acquir'd in the year 1668, by the Conqueſt of <hi>Franche-Contè,</hi> which he ſubdu'd in leſs than two Months.</p>
            <p>During the War of 1672, he had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd himſelf at the Battle of <hi>Seneff,</hi> and the next he perform'd as much as could be expected from ſo great a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The King alſo judg'd no body ſo fit to ſupply the Roome of Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who was ſlain in <hi>Germany.</hi> All this extremely perplex'd the Confeſſor, who was afraid of nothing ſo much, as that the Prince ſhould be again admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Favour: From which he had always found the knack to debar him till then. Therefore to prevent it he redoubl'd his Efforts; and prepoſſeſs'd the King in ſuch a manner, that after that Campain he never was any more entruſted with any Command. He laid before the King without Intermiſſion, that the Prince being extremely Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it concern'd his Majeſty not to put ſuch opportunities into his hands for the aquiſition of Glory; nor to permit him by that means to become more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the Kingdom than he was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63944:110"/>
already: that it behov'd him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the trouble he had put him to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Minority, when his deſigns made ſuch a noiſe that the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was conſtrain'd to ſeize his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and with what Animoſity, from his Enlargment in 1651, to 1659, he had made War againſt his Majeſty, who was forc'd by Treaty to receive him, tho without advancing him to thoſe high Places and Dignities which he had before: that if at that time he thought it good Policy to keep him in a midling Condition, to prevent him from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing to his prejudice, the ſame reaſons obliged his Majeſty to look more narrowly after him: That the Prince's Vexation and Diſcontents were viſible, and that maugre all the care which he took to conceal it, he could not forbear to diſplay his diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions upon ſeveral occaſions, by comparing his preſent condition with what he had been formerly. So that his Majeſty had all the reaſon in the world to be aſſur'd, that his Great Heart and his Ambition importun'd him without ceaſing to extraordinary Attempts; and that all things being well conſider'd, he was the only Prince
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63944:111"/>
in a condition to oppoſe if not to ſtop the Career of his Majeſties Glorious Deſigns: that he ought to conſider ſeriouſly the incumbrances he would meet with, if the Prince ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Head the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and at the ſame time make an Alliance with <hi>Holland:</hi> that would not only be able to ſtop his Progreſs, but alſo to introduce the Enemy into the Heart of his Kingdom; and then the leaſt miſchief that could befall him would be to make an ignominious Peace, and reſtore the <hi>Huguenots</hi> their Antient Privileges.</p>
            <p>All theſe Reaſons being urg'd by <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> and ſeconded by <hi>Louvois,</hi> made the King reſolve to confer no more Employments upon the Prince, who on the other ſide perceiving the ſuſpitions which the Court had of him, and how he was lookt upon with an evil Eye, retir'd to his Palace of <hi>Chantilli,</hi> where he was in hopes to live and dye quietly, without pretending any more to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick buſineſs. But it was ordain'd that his Generoſity and his great Heart ſhould always be the cauſe of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. For about the end of the year 1683, being inform'd by M. <hi>Montauzier</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:63944:111"/>
of a Cruel Order which <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> had obtain'd of the King, and which he was preparing to put in excution, he could not endure ſuch Barbarities without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his Mind. Thereupon he went to the Court, and throwing himſelf at the Kings Fleet, laid before him how great a ſtain ſuch a foul Action would be to his Honour: that he himſelf had ſeveral times oblig'd himſelf by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to make uſe of Violent Courſes and ſanguinary Ways; but tho he had never engag'd his Royal Word, yet that the Intereſt of his Honour and his Fame were ſufficient to divert him from ſo black an Eterprize, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a moſt Chriſtian King as that was; that there were other ways for his Majeſty to reduce the Proteſtants: that they were already in ſo low a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they were not able to make Head againſt him: and if the worſt came to the worſt, he might baniſh 'em out of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Theſe Remonſtrances of the Prince wrought ſo effectually upon the King, that he revok'd his Order, and <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was diſappointed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:63944:112"/>But his Animoſity upon this redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he made uſe of this occaſion to let the King underſtand, that the reaſon why the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> oppos'd with ſo much heat the deſtruction of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> was only becauſe it would utterly ruin thoſe deſigns, which he was meditating to put into their Heads: and the Cunning Prieſt made uſe of ſeveral kindneſſes which afterwards the Prince deſir'd in favour of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him odious to the King, and caſt him abſolutely but of his Favour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſucceeded but too well; it being certain that after that, the King could hardly endure to ſee him.</p>
            <p>1686. At length this Great Prince dy'd the 16th of <hi>December</hi> 1686, at <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bleau,</hi> whither he went to ſee his Grandaughter, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who lay ſick of the Small Pox; and many People were of Opinion that the Jeſuits did not a little contribute to haſten his Death.</p>
            <p>He wrote a very Pathetick Letter to the King, wherein he expreſt his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for having born Arms againſt his Majeſty, proteſting withal, that ſince his return, he had never had any other than Sentiments of Reſpect and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63944:112"/>
for his Perſon, and Fidelity to his Service, whatever ſuſpitions had been infus'd into him to the contrary: as in regard he had been in part the cauſe of the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s misfortune, he begg'd his pardon with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubmiſſion in that Letter, aſſuring the King, that the Prince was as good and faithful a Subject as his Majeſty could wiſh or deſire; adding withal that Father <hi>la Chaiſè</hi> knew well what he ſaid to be truth, if he would vouchſafe to teſtifie the Truth.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Camus</hi> alſo had incurr'd the Confeſſors diſpleaſure, much upon the ſame account, and for the ſame Reaſon as the Prince. He wrote to the King a Letter wherein he lai'd it before him, that it was neither for his Honour, nor did it become his Juſtice to uſe violent means; that for his part he could not approve of 'em, and therefore beſought his Majeſty, not to take it amiſs, if within his own Dioceſs, he qualifi'd and ſoften'd ſuch boiſtrous proceedings as much as lay in his Power. At which the King being provok'd, wrote a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Letter to the Intendant of the Dioceſs, againſt the Cardinal, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſhew it him. There upon the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63944:113"/>
Cardinal wrote to the Intendant that Famous Letter, wherein he proves, that Rigorous and Bloody means are not to be made uſe of to reduce People to the Religion they have forſaken, and that there is no other way to deal with the Conſcience but by perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Our Jeſuit therefore, who is a ſworn Enemy to all thoſe who concur not blindly with his deſigns, incens'd the King againſt him withal his might, and obtain'd a Warrant alſo to ſend him to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> which was revok'd ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the interceſſion of the Duke of <hi>Montauzier.</hi> However afterwards this worthy Prelate was haunted with a thouſand vexations, tho the only perſon that we have in <hi>France</hi> that lives a life ſo exemplary and ſo like a true Biſhop.</p>
            <p>He was formerly a Courtier and one that had very far engag'd himſelf in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and a luxurious Life; but at length retiring from the world, leading a very Vertuous and Pious Life, the King made him Biſhop of <hi>Grenoble.</hi> For which when he went to return thanks to his Majeſty, he took his leave of him for all his Life after: where upon the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Reaſon why he bid him ſo long a farwell, he anſwer'd that reſidence
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63944:113"/>
was of Divine Right, and that he thought himſelf oblig'd to reſide in his Dioceſs, as he had reſolv'd to do, till death.</p>
            <p>After he came to be a Biſhop, he liv'd altogether upon Pulſe, and gave himſelf entirely up to all the care &amp; Functions of a Charitable Paſtor, Preaching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his people, viſiting the Poor, the Widows and the Orphans whom he always reliev'd to the utmoſt of his power: Such eminent Vertues and ſo rate a Piety, produc'd him the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap, and the particular affection of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. And this was that which rendred <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> ſo irreconcileable to him, that he could not expect from him for the future any other then the utmoſt of miſchief that he could do him.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to ſpeak of all things at once; ſo that I had like to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the blackeſt Circumſtances of <hi>la Chaiſe</hi>'s Life, which was very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Chriſtendom; and therefore I muſt be forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to run backward for ſome years.</p>
            <p>All the world knows, how the King fell upon <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> by means of the Correſpondence which he held with the new Burgomaſters, under pretence that that City was the Capital City of <hi>Alſatia,</hi>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:63944:114"/>
and belong'd to him as a Dependance of that Province which was ſurrendred to him by the Peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi> The Emperor and all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> highly complain'd of this Breach, which together with the Blocking up of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi> and detaining the Caſtle of <hi>Dinant,</hi> which was to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the Prince of <hi>Liege,</hi> were cauſes more than ſufficient to renew the War, with which they threaten'd him in Conjunction with <hi>Spain.</hi> Expedients were propos'd in Council to prevent all this, and it was <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s advice, to make an Alliance with the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Truce between whom and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was ready to expire, and who would be able to make a Powerful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion with never ſo little Aſſiſtance. With all, that it was neceſſary to engage the K. of <hi>Poland</hi> in the ſame League, who had been beholding to <hi>France</hi> for his Crown; to which purpoſe he ſhould be tempted with the Conqueſt of <hi>Sileſu</hi> that lay ſo convenient for him. M. <hi>de Boncherat</hi> and M. <hi>Montauſier</hi> were of a Contrary Opinion, and laid before his Majeſty that beſides the ſtain it would be to his Honour, it would be to call in an Enemy that would not be ſo eaſie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63944:114"/>
to be driven out again, whereas it was eaſie to diſſipate this appearance of a League by raiſing the Blockade of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi> and letting his pretentions to the County of <hi>Aloſt</hi> ſleep a while. Which would ſuffice without doubt to oblige thoſe Princes patiently to ſuffer the taking of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> But the Marquis of <hi>Louvois</hi> ſtill inſiſted that an Alliance with the <hi>Turk</hi> was the only way to keep all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> in in awe, who would be glad that his Majeſty would grant 'em Peace, which he might or might not do as he ſaw his Advantages. But that he had great probability of a much better Progreſs; it being certain that if the <hi>Turks</hi> got the upper hand, and that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> acted his part, the Princes of the Empire would of their own accord be forc'd to call his Majeſty to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and perhaps would be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to declare him Emperor, or at leaſt, the Crown of the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> could not fail the <hi>Dauphin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this there was at that time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concluded; the King delaying the matter, till he had conſulted his Council of Conſcience, or rather his Confeſſor, with whom he is infatuated;

And indeed it was by his inſtigation that the Jeſuits of <hi>Vienna</hi> perſwaded the Emperor to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Proteſtants of <hi>Hungary</hi> more then ever, that ſo they might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to revolt; and furniſh'd Court <hi>Tekeli</hi> with means to ſupport himſelf; who unleſs that Perſecution had been redoubl'd, would have run the hazard of being abandon'd by his own Party. He was alſo ſuppli'd from <hi>France</hi> with what money he wanted. And Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> it was that recommended to the <hi>K.</hi> the perſon, who was moſt of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by him in that Negotiation; one <hi>Rouvrai</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a new Catholick, and allur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as he had occaſion ſeveral times to paſs to and fro through <hi>Vienna,</hi> he perform'd the Office of a Spie, to obſerve what paſt in that Court, not at all terrifi'd with the accident at that time newly befallen the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of M. <hi>Seppeville</hi> the French Agent.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63944:115"/>
That Secretary was another Spie, who convey'd many a French Letter to Count <hi>Tekeli,</hi> and gave an account to both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of what paſt in <hi>Vienna,</hi> by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one <hi>Bohan,</hi> a French Officer in the Service of the Count, and who for a long time drove the ſame trade with <hi>Rouvrai.</hi> But the Secretary was ſurpiz'd in this dangerous Calling, and put in Priſon, from whence he had never got out again ſafe and ſound, had not the King, ſo ſoon as he heard of it, ſeiz'd upon Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> the Emperors Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at <hi>Paris,</hi> by way of Repriſal. When this Secretary was taken, there was found in his Pocket a Letter which <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> had written to <hi>Rouvrai,</hi> and which was ſeen by all that were then at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> of which that which follows is a Copy.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63944:116"/>
that the difficulty of finding a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Money has been the only reaſon that the King's Promiſes have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto delay'd.

            <p>This Letter diſcover'd ſome part of the Fathers Plots and underhand Practices, and tho he ſtiffly deny'd that ever he wrote it, which he might the more eaſily do, becauſe it was not ſign'd, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Secretary imprudently confeſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in <hi>Poland</hi> were alſo underſtood; and the knowledge of 'em contributed not a little to prevent the Effect. For M. <hi>Zierowsky</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſador at that Court, ſo lively repreſented to the King the injury it would be to his Honour and his Intereſt, to aſſiſt the Conqueſts of the Infidels in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which would indeed be no more then a preparing of Shackles for himſelf (ſince it was very evident the moſt dangerous Neighbour he had in the World was the <hi>Turk</hi>) that he enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63944:117"/>
a ſtrict Alliance with his Imperial Majeſty.

            </p>
            <p>In the Mean time the Infidels having forc'd the Paſs of <hi>Raab,</hi> which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtay'd to beſiege no more then they did <hi>Comorra,</hi> advanc'd with a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army as far a <hi>Vienna;</hi> which they beſieg'd, and ſtrook terror into all the Countries round about. At the ſame time alſo, the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was very much tempted to lay hold upon the occaſion, brought four Armies into the Field, one in <hi>Flanders,</hi> another in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> a third upon the <hi>Saone,</hi> and another upon the <hi>Saonr,</hi> Which alarm'd no leſs this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> then the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:63944:117"/>
               <hi>Ottamons</hi> did the other. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe were no frivolous fears, for to ſpeak the Truth, the King had laid aſide all Scruples, and had made a moſt terrible Invaſion, if <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> had not ſtop'd him. And this was the only time that his Councils were favourable to <hi>Europe.</hi> But we owe him no thanks for this Obligation; for if he had thought he had done well, he would never have done it.</p>
            <p>He advis'd the King not to enter by force of Arms into a Country which he might ſubdue when he pleas'd by bare perſwaſion. That all the Princes of the Empire were generally in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, that if he did but ſend any perſon of Wit and Reputation to act among 'em, 'twas certain they would call him in themſelves of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and that he might reckon himſelf ſure of the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion poſſeſs'd the faireſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries upon the <hi>Rhine:</hi> And as for the reſt, it would be no hard matter to gain 'em. But Sir, ſaid he, ſhould not this way ſucceed, your Majeſty will be always in a Condition to make uſe of your Power. The King believ'd him and recall'd his Armies. Preſently the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63944:118"/>
               <hi>Furſtembergs</hi> were written to, in order to this Affair, who faild not to do their utmoſt; more eſpecially <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> a Creature ſo devoted to the King, that he had not a perſon in all his Kingdom ſo much his purchas'd Slave as he. A perſon who will afford us ample matter of diſcourſe in the following Sheets, and therefore it will not be amiſs that the Reader ſhould have a little taſte of his character before hand.</p>
            <p>He is a <hi>German</hi> by Birth of a Noble and Antient Family which has done the Emperors great Services at ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, for which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd conſiderable advantages, and were advanc'd to the Higheſt Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Empire. The Emperor now Reigning rais'd this very Perſon to be a Prince of the Empire in his Youth, and beſides that, beſtow'd upon him and his Brothers ſeveral fair Fiefs of the Empire, as well in the Circles of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> as elſewhere. But the Accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo many Favours could not make him ere the more Greatful to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors; he quitted his Party, and went into <hi>France,</hi> where the King, who had his deſire, receiv'd him very nobly,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63944:118"/>
gave him a Penſion of ſix thouſand Crowns a Year, and made him Collonel of a Regiment which he commanded ſeveral Years. All this while his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in the Service of the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> whoſe Prime Miniſter he was, and whom Prince <hi>William</hi> gain'd over to the King in ſuch a manner, that while he liv'd, he was no ill wiſher to his ſide.</p>
            <p>The War of 72, being broke out, they began to talk of Peace as ſoon as it was begun, and the next Year there was a Congreſs at <hi>Cologne</hi> of Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries from all the Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> Prince <hi>William</hi> was nominated for the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts would not acknowledge him; and which was worſe, he was ſeiz'd and carri'd to <hi>Vienna</hi> as a Rebel to his Prince, and guilty of High Treaſon againſt him. This mannner of proceeding, which the King pretended was againſt the Law of Nations, put an end to all the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, and broke up the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Tho the Court of <hi>France</hi> were very much afraid leaſt the Prince of <hi>Furſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> would have been very ſeverely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt, whether it were that the Emperor fear'd thereby to render
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63944:119"/>
the King irreconcileable, or that he thought he had a pledge in his hands that would facilitate a Peace when he pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d himſelf I ſhall not diſpute; but however it were, he only kept him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. When the War was at an end, he was releas'd, and the King obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as great a Buſtler and as much a Boutefeu as he was, he was no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, caus'd him to exchange his Sword for a Breviary, and made him Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> Nor did his kindneſs for him bound it ſelf there, for he nominated him to a Cardinalſhip, and put the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net himſelf upon his Head in <hi>Jan.</hi> 87, and the next year caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Coadjutor to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> which was done the 7th of <hi>Jan.</hi> by eight a Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>But to return to the matter in hand, he was employ'd during the Conjuncture of the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to perſwade the Princes of the Empire to have recourſe to the King; but his employing a ſuſpected perſon was not the way to ſucceed: he was too well known, and it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a propoſition to come from him, to render it ſuſpitious. So that all his jaunting to and fro ſignifi'd nothing, but only to give the King of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63944:119"/>
               <hi>Poland</hi> leiſure to joyn the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Relieve <hi>Vienna,</hi> into which they enter'd triumphant after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the Infidels, of whom they made a moſt terrible Slaughter, and put the reſt to the moſt dreadful Flight that ever was known.

            <p>The King, having beheld this Great Deliverance, alter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>d the <hi>Spaniards</hi> about the County of <hi>Aloſt,</hi> conſiderable for the Extent and Revenue of it, which he claim'd as a Dependance upon his Conqueſts; and upon the King of <hi>Spains</hi> refuſing it, he Beſieg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> and took it in lieu of an Equivalent. All people thought that then the War would have broke out again more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly then ever. But the weakneſs of the Emperors Forces, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors deſire to proſecute his Victorys in <hi>Hungary,</hi> were the reaſon that all their
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63944:120"/>
differences were put an end to, and laid a ſleep by a General Truce concluded in the Year 1685.</p>
            <p>While theſe things thus paſs'd on, <hi>Charles</hi> the II. King of <hi>England</hi> dy'd, and left the Crown to his Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who tho generally ill belov'd by the People and a declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So happy a Succeſs, and perhaps ſo little expected, ſpread an Univerſal joy among all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, who promis'd themſelves no leſs then the entire reducing that Kingdom under their Dominion, in three or four Years at moſt: and they had already devour'd in imagination all the Noble Biſhopricks and Conſiderable Benefices in the Realm: nor indeed were their hopes ſo Chimerical, but that they might have reaſon to have ſome aſſurance of it: they were abſolutely Maſters of the new Kings Heart and Soul, who was wholly govern'd by them; as being to ſpeak properly, no more then their Prime Miniſter of State in his own Kingdom. Beſides, they were protected by <hi>France,</hi> extremely Potent, and near at hand to pour in thirty thouſand men into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> when ever he pleas'd. 'Tis true this
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63944:120"/>
could not have been done without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the King, whoſe Authority would have been not a little diminiſh'd thereby; but what car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now as the whole company in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had great reaſon to be over joy'd at ſuch a promiſing Event, Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> in particular had more engaging motives of Exultation and Triumph. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd King <hi>Charles</hi> had willingly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd to his Councils, and had done ſeveral things in complacence to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but at the bottom he was a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prince, and one who, otherwiſe loving his Pleaſures and his Eaſe, did not always do that which was deſir'd of him; nor was he of a humour to hazard the whole for nothing, like his Brother, who not having all the foreſight imaginable, but perſwading himſelf, in imitation of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, that there needed no more for him to do but to attempt and Proſper, blindly and erroniouſly deliver'd himſelf up to Evil Counſels. Upon which Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> erected his project to ſet all <hi>Europe</hi> in a Conflagration of War, the moſt violent that ere was known, and hugg'd himſelf in his deſign, which he lookt upon then as infallible.</p>
            <p>

So that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he began hardly to obſerve any Meaſures; wherefore in a ſhort time, the Kingdom was full of Monks of all Orders, and particularly Jeſuits, who were become ſuch favourites at Court, that there was nothing to be there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd but by application made to them. And upon theirs and Father <hi>Peters</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was an Iriſh-man by Birth, and low in Fortune; he came young into <hi>England,</hi> where he ſerv'd as a kind of Page for above ten Years at the end of which time, he met with a Catholick who prefer'd him to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> in the quality of a better ſort of Gentle man. This was the Riſe of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But to return to King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He receiv'd a Nuncio from the Pope into <hi>London;</hi> which had not been known

for above an Age before: this was the Abbot <hi>Dada,</hi> ſince made a Cardinal. Some few days after his arrival he was conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Amaſia</hi> in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chapel, by the titular Archbiſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> and two other Biſhops; and in the Afternoon coming to pay his Reſpects to their Majeſties, they fell upon their Knees before him, to receive his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Hitherto the Nuncio had only appear'd incognito; which not ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, who pretended to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Hugger Mugger, he reſolv'd that he ſhould make his publick Entry, and choſe <hi>Windſor</hi> for the Place. To this purpoſe, he orderd the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> firſt Gentleman of his Chamber to go the next day to waite upon the Prelate at his Lodgings, and conduct him to his Audience. The Duke would fain have ſhifted off the Employment, by telling the King, that it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to all the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that had been made upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but then the King caſting an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry look upon him, <hi>Do,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>as you are commanded, I ask not your Advice.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the Duke continu'd his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, declaring to the King that there were ſeveral others who would obey his

Orders with leſs Reluctancy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſought his Majeſty to lay his Commands upon them, rather then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; <hi>Very Good,</hi> reply'd the King, <hi>I ſhall do it, but it ſhall coſt you your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Firſt Gentleman;</hi> and ſo turning to the Duke of <hi>Grafton</hi> who was then in the Chamber. <hi>Duke of</hi> Grafton, <hi>ſaid he, go to morrow and fetch Monſieur the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio in my own Coaches of State, and be you henceforward firſt Gentleman inſtead of the Duke of</hi> Somerſet. Nor did the Kings Wrath againſt the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi> end there; he took from him his Regiment of Dragoons, and caſt him quite out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The next day the Nuncio made his Entrance, in the view of all the People, in a Violet Habit, his Rochet and<note n="*" place="margin">Habit of a Purple Colour, reſembling a Captains Gorget, worn by a Pontifical Biſhop above his Rochet, and reaching down to the bending of his Arms.</note> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mail.</p>
            <p>All this was done at the inſtigation of Father <hi>Peters,</hi> who was ſomething more in <hi>England,</hi> then <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was in <hi>France.</hi> And this latter ſeeing to his great ſatisfaction King <hi>James</hi>'s weak ſide, is reference to <hi>Peters,</hi> reſolv'd to make him ſerviceable to advance his own Grandeur.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63944:122"/>
That ambitious Jeſuit <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> had been a long time aſpiring to a Cardinals Cap; but in regard that ſince the Pontificate of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. the Holy See had never had a more implacable Enemy then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he juſtly queſtion'd whether the Pope would grant that favour to the K. of <hi>France,</hi> tho he ſhould demand it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome other ſhould level the way before-hand, and that upon his Holineſs's having granted the ſame Honour to ſome other of his Character, he might claim a Priviledge to pretend to it. Not that he hop'd to attain his Ends while the Reigning Pope liv'd, who had no kindneſs at all for him, but after his Death.</p>
            <p>Therefore he put it into the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Head to demand the Purple for his own Confeſſor, and at the ſame time to make him a Biſhop, giving him to underſtand, that it would be the eaſieſt thing in the world to obtain it, and that the Pope would be glad of the opportunity to oblige him. But it fell out quite otherwiſe: for when the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was about to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to the Pope, he impos'd ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon him with a Benediction; which in the Vatican is a Language
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63944:123"/>
that all men underſtand. And as for the Diſpenſations which he demanded for the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> to which <hi>Peters</hi> was promoted, the Pope return'd for anſwer, that the Jeſuits, having by their inſtitutions renounc'd all manner of Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, they could not ſo much as think of thoſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Crime, in regard it is a very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crime for a Religious perſon to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Conſtitutions of his Order. 'Twas in vain for the Ambaſſador to tell him a Story, that the Rules of their Order did not bind em ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolubly but that they might have a Diſpenſation when the good of the Church requir'd it: that his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had made no ſcruple to advance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Jeſuits to the Epiſcopacy, and ſome to the Purple: beſides that, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions had now no more the ſame force then formerly, as conſiſting only in the free will of the Pope: in regard that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by expreſs Bulls, that the form of 'em might be alter'd in one or more Caſes, according to the nature of the buſineſs. But the Pope remain'd in exora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all theſe plauſible reaſons, and <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was forc'd to deſiſt his ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63944:123"/>
The greateſt vexation for the miſcarriage of this Affair was <hi>la Chaiſes,</hi> who had blink'd a long time upon the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Lyon,</hi> as a Benefice to which he had a kind of claim to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of the Red Cap. For as to what concern'd Father <hi>Peters,</hi> the King found a way to comfort him for the loſs of what he never had, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his <hi>Grand Almoner,</hi> and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Kinſman the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> no longer queſtioning that there was any favour to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Holy See, laid aſide all reſervedneſs, and hearkning only to his Revenge, ſpurr'd on the King to all thoſe extremities that afterwards brake forth. The Bull which the Pope in a little time after thunder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d out, to aboliſh the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Embaſſadors Quarters, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Excommunication, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe that ſhould go about to uphold 'em directly or indirectly, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him for a good occaſion. And tho the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſubmitted voluntarily to it, yet the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor gave the King to underſtand that it was a diminution of his Honour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their example, and that the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63944:124"/>
being a Prerogative belonging to his Crown, eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> not by a bare Connivance of the Popes, as they might perhaps in reſpect of other Princes, but by Cuſtom and ſpecial Priviledge, of which he had been in Poſſeſſion ever ſince <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and lately acknowledg'd by the Treaty of <hi>Piſa,</hi> he was not to give an Inch of Ground upon that point.</p>
            <p>'Tis no difficult thing to perſwade Princes to thoſe things which they deem for their advantage; more eſpecially, when they have the Power in their own hands. The King was convinc'd the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt time, that the Father ſpoke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reaſon, and finding him ſo well skill'd in a matter that he had ſtudy'd, he gave him order to draw up Inſtructions himſelf for the Marquis of <hi>Lavardin,</hi> whom he had made choice of for his Ambaſſador, in the room of the Duke <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> and to diſcourſe him particularly upon the Subject, that he might not be ignorant of the leaſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. So that it was the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſpirit that animated and enliven'd the Marquis, and by which he acted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together after that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:63944:124"/>The Pope who was faithfully adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd by Cardinal <hi>Ranunci,</hi> his Nuncio at <hi>Paris,</hi> of all theſe Proceedings; and to whom the King himſelf had refus'd Audience, becauſe he would have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him the Bull revocatory, offer'd Cardinal <hi>d' Etree,</hi> that if he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Bull which he had ſet forth, which was a very juſt one, and which he could not revoke without extreme detriment to the Church, that the <hi>Sbirri</hi> or Officers of Juſtice, ſhould forbear making any Aſſaults upon the Quarters, and that nothing ſhould be done to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Kings intereſt. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal who found himſelf at a loſs in this Negotiation, approv'd the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and advis'd the K. to it in a Letter, which being imparted to Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> he oppos'd it, and ſaid that the Bull being an abuſe, there was a neceſſity of Appealing and referring the matter to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which the Pope underſtanding, wrote to him very ſmartly, complaining, that ſince he was become his Confeſſor, inſtead of perſwading the King to ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Piety and Goodneſs, he had always incens'd him againſt the Holy See, as in the buſineſs of the Regale, and now upon this occaſion, where the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:63944:125"/>
moſt juſt Rights of the Church were concern'd, which he incited his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to violate; and which would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very evil Conſequences, which would all light heavy upon him, and for which he muſt anſwer before God.</p>
            <p>The Reſolutions of the Holy Father to uphold his Pious deſign, put a ſtop for ſome Months to <hi>Lavardins</hi> departure. But at length he ſetforward in <hi>November</hi> 87. and made his publick Entry in deſpite of the Pope, who would not acknowledge him for an Embaſſador. It was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in Council, whether they ſhould ſhut the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt him. But the Plurality of voices not being for carrying things to that extremity, the Pope thought it ſufficient to forbid the Cardinals and all the Princes and Lords to ſend their Coaches to meet him; he alſo forbid the diſcharging of any Great Guns, and all other publick marks of rejoycing. But for all theſe Inhibitions there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred Foreigners Coaches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of the ſeveral Ambaſſadors.

him likewiſe to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where the Ambaſſador having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Audience, it was refus'd him; after which he went to the Palace of the <hi>Farneſi.</hi> He was attended by three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred French Gentlemen, who ſtaid in <hi>Rome,</hi> as long as he did; not reckoning in a conſiderable number of the Officers of the Gallys, who arriv'd in a ſhort time after; and I know not how many Lords that reſorted to him from all parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> More then this he kept five hundred Men in Pay, to whom he gave a <hi>Julio</hi> a day, and theſe Soldiers guarded his Palace a Foot and a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and went the Patroll every Night in his Quarter.</p>
            <p>Upon the day of his Entrance, the Pope caus'd the Bull which he had ſet forth before againſt the Franchiſes, to be fix'd up a new, forbidding all People to acknowledge <hi>Lavardin</hi> for Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; who had no ſooner notice of it, but in oppoſition and to be even with the pope he caus'd Placarts to be paſted up in all the Corners of the Streets, forbidding the <hi>Sbirri</hi> to preſume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach within five hundred Paces of his Quarter, threatning to put all to the Sword that ſhould be met within that

Tis true that <hi>Talon</hi> drew up the firſt draught of it, and ſhew'd it to the King, but Father <hi>la Chaſe</hi> who was preſent and read it to his Majeſty, told him that the Writing was excellently well penn'd, but that it was not ſmart enough, neither did it ſufficiently ſet forth his Majeſties cauſes

of complaint againſt the Pope; and that it was of great Importance to ſhew to all the World and to Poſterity, the Partialy and Paſſion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father upon that occaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King bid 'em meet both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the afternoon, and to add or alter what they thought proper. This order very much diſpleas'd M. <hi>Talon,</hi> who could not digeſt it, that a Prieſt ſhould be put upon him to teach him his Trade; and two days after he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifi'd his reſentment to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> to whom he ſaid in expreſs terms, that tho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body ſhould meddle with his Trade, the Cows would be never a whit the better kept for all that.</p>
            <p>However, he obey'd without ſaying a word, and all that day they labour'd about that famous declamation which has made ſuch a noiſe, and which is only ſtuft with threats of a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which would impower the Biſhops to Conſecrate one another, if the Pope refus'd to do it, and to Excommunicate his Holineſs himſelf, if he went about to thunder out his Excommunications. <hi>Si Excommunicatus veniret, Excommuica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus abiret.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1688"/> There was nothing diſcours'd of, but <hi>Paſſion, deſire of Domineering, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations of the Court of</hi> Rome. The Holy Father was contemn'd and ſlighted, as a man of a weak and ſhallow Pate, not able to bear the burthen of Affairs, and ſometimes they call'd him declar'd favorour and Protector of the <hi>Quietiſts and Janſeniſts.</hi> In ſhort they Curſt and Anathamatiz'd him in expreſs terms. <hi>A Curſe and Anathema,</hi> ſays the Writing, <hi>on all thoſe, who either through Intereſt or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio trouble the correſpondency that is to be between the Prieſthood and the Royalty, who ſeem to have no other Proſpect but to raiſe Schiſm in the Church, and with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diviſions to diſturb the Peace of all</hi> Europe, <hi>which has been procur'd by the Wiſdom of our Invincible Monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which was more to be wonder'd at was, that <hi>Lavardin</hi> caus'd both the Plea and the Decree to be fix'd upon the Doors of the <hi>Vatican.</hi> The Pope ſurpriz'd at ſuch an act of daring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption as that, forbid all the Churches to admit the Prieſts who had officiated in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Lewis:</hi> And one poor Almoner, belonging to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, having taken a walk impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently toward the <hi>Vatican,</hi> was ſeiz'd

The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> among the Reſt, zealous as he always uſes to be, for the Kings Intereſt, put this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exactly in execution. He choſe to that purpoſe for his Official one <hi>Cheron,</hi> a man learned and fit for buſineſs, whom he ſent to all the Conventual Houſes, to let 'em know the Kings intentions. And indeed the Generality of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks, as well Monks as others, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd themſelves, to that blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that was expected. Only ſome three or four Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and ſome Capuchins and Dominicans took the Popes part: but they were reduc'd to reaſon by a Privy Signet Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſent 'em to make a noiſe above a hunder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Leagues off: upon which all the reſt lay'd their Fingers upon their Mouths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:63944:130"/>The Pope, inform'd of all this, would not make uſe of his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Thunders, for fear of expoſing 'em to the deriſion of a Prince that little regarded 'em; but rather deſiring to find out ſome expedient for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he order'd Cardinal <hi>de Eſtree</hi> to be acquainted, that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearken to him, in reference to the Differences which he had with the Moſt Chriſtian King.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal anſwer'd the Pope, that he was infinitely oblig'd to his Holineſs for his particular goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and that he was at his wits end to ſee that he could not correſpon'd with it, the King his Maſter having ty'd up his hands in this Affair, and forbid him to meddle with it ſo long as his Ambaſſador was at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An anſwer ſo dry and ſapleſs, did not however extinguiſh his Holineſſe's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to contribute all that lay in his power toward an Amicable concluſion of this Conteſt, and touch'd with the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which his Excommunication would bring upon Chriſtendom, through the King of <hi>Frances</hi> obſtinacy, which he had made appear by ſo many publick
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63944:131"/>
Acts, he reſolv'd to take it off. By this means St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Church became f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee to all the world, and as well <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> as <hi>French</hi> reſorted to it. This manner of procedure was lookt upon as a great Weakneſs in the Holy Father, and a moſt inexcuſable want of Courage, after ſuch a Stiffneſs as the Pope had ſhew'd: but if we rightly conſider things, we ſhall find that the Pope never did a more prudent Act, nor more charitable, or more becoming the Vicar of Chriſt. He knew thoſe ſpiritual Weapons, ſo terrible to all the truly faithful, were not put into his hands but only to reduce under obedience ſuch as obſtinately ſtray'd from the Truth; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent others through a holy fear from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Example. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons therefore he thought it behov'd him to make uſe of 'em upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, piouſly perſwaded, that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Error were not got up to that high degree in <hi>France,</hi> as to be in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſuch Celeſtial Chaſtiſements. But when he ſaw they had not that ſucceſs which he expected, rather quite the Contrary, that his proceeding in that manner, how juſt ſo ever it were, had exaſperated the minds of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63944:131"/>
him; that all the Clergy was ready to revolt, and that he had all the reaſon in the world to be afraid of a Schiſm in the Church, he relented on a ſudden, to ſtop the Torrent of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He never conſulted Fleſh or Blood, but without any regard to what all the World could ſay of him upon ſuch a Relaxation, he thought it his duty to ſacrifice a vain point of Honour to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Cologne</hi> dy'd, leaving three fair Epiſcopal Principalities vacant, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pretenders to 'em. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Furſtenburgh</hi> was one of the firſt that appear'd upon the Stage. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Coadjutor in the chiefeſt of theſe Principalities, but he had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Pope; and ſo all things were to begin again. And indeed 'twas he who loſt the moſt by the quarrels between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Pope who perfectly well knew which way that Prelate was devoted, never minded the doing any thing for him at ſuch a time as that. So that the Cardinal, who was not ignorant of his condition, wrote ſeveral times to Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> and endeavour'd to make him
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63944:132"/>
ſenſible that the Affair of the Franchiſes could not be of that importance to the K. as a concern, which indeed was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of all the Lower <hi>Rhine,</hi> and of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then that; and therefore that it would be convenient to releaſe it to the Pope, at leaſt for ſome time till the King might be more at leiſure to reaſſume his Challenges. The ſame things were likewiſe ſeveral times repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King by Prince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Furſtenburgh;</hi> and certain it is, that the King had given way, if <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> who mortally hated the Pope, out of a deſire of revenge, had not diverted him, telling him, that he might if he pleas'd himſelf procure the Election of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> without having recourſe to ſuch a burdenſome expedient: That there needed no more for that purpoſe, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en to let the Chapters underſtand his pleaſure; or to make the buſineſs more ſure, he might order ſome of his Forces to advance that way: which the King did, under pretence of ſecuring to the Capitulars the Freedom of their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but in reallity to deprive 'em of it, and force 'em to comply with his good Will and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:63944:132"/>His Ambaſſador <hi>d' Avaux</hi> declar'd at the ſame time to the Sates of <hi>Holland,</hi> that his Maſter underſtood that the Three Chapters were to be left to their free choice; and that no Prince was to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in their Affairs; and therefore he threaten'd that if any Prince ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to buſie himſelf in what concern'd him not, he would be ready to ſide with the Chapters that were interrupted and injur'd in their Rights.</p>
            <p>But nothing was ſo pleaſant, as the compliment which his Envoy made to thoſe of <hi>Liege.</hi> He told 'em, that the King his Maſter out of that Affection and Friendſhip he had for 'em, had ſent ten thouſand men to quarter near their City, at a vaſt charge, to ſupport 'em in their freedom of Election; which however, he hop'd would be in favour of Prince <hi>William,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he could not forbear to put 'em in mind, that the half of their City depended upon the County of <hi>Chini,</hi> which belong'd to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe menaces, how terrible ſoever they were, how ever wrought little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect, then to make the Chapter encline, not to Cardinal <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> for they lookt upon him as an Enemy of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63944:133"/>
their Country; but in favour of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> whom they offer'd the King ſeveral times, to Elect.</p>
            <p>But Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> put a ſpoke in his Wheel. He was <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s Enemy; and therefore without ceaſing laid before the King, that if once that Cardinal ſhould arrive to that degree of Soveraignty, he would infallibly call to mind all the acts of Injuſtice that, as he pretends, have been done his Family, and his late Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> He ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all this with the ſecret cauſes of that Prelates diſgrace, which made a deep impreſſion in the Kings mind, and put him in fear in earneſt, that if he ſhould once come to be Prince of <hi>Liege,</hi> he would preſently ſide with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. However it were, we know not, but we have ſince found that <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was no Conjurer, in regard we have ſeen by what that Cardinal did at <hi>Rome,</hi> how faithful and Affectionate he was to the King.</p>
            <p>I have formerly ſaid that Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> did a great deal of Miſchief, but no body any good; which, to ſpeak ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is very true; but as there is no general Rule without Exceptions, there may be found an Exception in this, as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63944:133"/>
well as in others; and the Count of <hi>Marce,</hi> Nephew to Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us one. He ſought in Marriage the Daughter of M. <hi>de Boisfrane,</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of Monſieur's Houſe; but turn'd out of his Place by reaſon of his Rapines and Extortions. Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was very much his Friend, and therefore Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi> deſir'd him to aſſiſt her toward the concluding of that Match, which otherwiſe they durſt not propoſe, in regard the young Lady had refus'd the Duke of <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> when the Duke his Father was at the higheſt of his Gandeur. However ſhe had a great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the value of eight hundred thouſand Livres, which was a Sum ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to tempt a more conſiderable Nobleman, then the Count of <hi>Marce.</hi> He therefore lookt upon the Lady as one that might be the making of him; and thought he could never make the Confeſſor amends for the great pains he had taken to bring about the Match: tho he did nothing but what he was bound in gratitude to do. For Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi> had done him greater ſervices then that, and he ſtood in need of her aſſiſtance every day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:63944:134"/>But we cannot ſay the ſame in reference to the Marquiſs of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> a perſon of as little Reputation as ever any at Court; ill ſhap'd, and very ſlender witted; yet marri'd about two years before to one of the Lovelieſt and the Richeſt Heireſſes of the Kingdom, <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi> Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi> who married one of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Neeces, upon condition that he ſhould aſſume the name and Arms; for, as for this man, he was the Son of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall <hi>de Meilleraye,</hi> Governor of <hi>Brittany.</hi> Every body knows how he liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In regard ſhe was very much like her Mother, both in the Features of her Face, as in her Humour, and that the uſual Proverb in the Duke of <hi>Mazrins</hi> Mouth was, <hi>That good Doggs hunt by Kind,</hi> he was very much afraid that ſhe would likewiſe no leſs reſemble her in her Life and Behaviour. To prevent this, he reſolv'd to keep her ſo ſhort, and to beſtow ſuch a vertuous Education upon
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63944:134"/>
her in her Infancy, as might vanquiſh the proneneſs of his Daughter to evil. To this purpoſe he always kept her in Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries; in the cuſtody of Good and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Governeſſes, who diſcours'd to her of nothing but God and his Saints; and for recreation, read to her nothing but the Lives of St. <hi>Reine,</hi> or St. <hi>Catherin</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> who had deſerv'd ſo much by her Devotion as to be marri'd to Chriſt himſelf, who deſcended from Heaven on purpoſe to eſpouſe her. Now tho all this bigotry did no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with her Genius, ſhe was forc'd to be contented with it, till ſhe came to be Seventeen or Eighteen years of Age. At what time the Bent of her Wit and diſpoſition beginning to fix, ſhe grew wily and cunning, and began to converſe with the young Nuns that were leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, who diſcover'd to her many things of which ſhe was ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, procur'd her Romances and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and many times the Courtſhip of Young Gallants. Of which the Duke being inform'd, he reſolv'd frequently to ſhift her from one place to another, to the end ſhe might not have time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into familiarities: beſides, he never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

old Nuns, of whom he was ſecure. But what ſignifi'd all theſe precautions to force back the nature of an Amorous young Girle, that glori'd in deceiving her Overſeers, and thought it no leſs neceſſary to boot. I ſaw her at <hi>Henne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> which is a Government in <hi>Bretagne</hi> belonging to her Father. He had plac'd her in the Abby <hi>de la Joye,</hi> under the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of an Antient and vertuous Matron, call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in a little time ſhe had ſo well learnt to win the heart of her Governeſs, and the other. Nuns by her Flatteries and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that they thought it not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to be ſo rigorous and ſo ſevere, to ſo amiable a young Girle. But he that contributed moſt to her liberty was one Father <hi>Cronier,</hi> Director of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and Confeſſor to Madam <hi>de Pleve,</hi> in whom ſhe had as great a Faith as in St. <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf, the Founder of the Order. This Monk was fallen in Love with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Mazarin,</hi> and left nothing omitted to pleaſe her. He put himſelf into red habit, carefully
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63944:135"/>
cleans'd his Teeth, and caſt as many ſmirking looks upon her as a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in a white Perriwig could have done. The young Lady who the very firſt time took pleaſure in hearing the Gayities of his wanton Addreſſes, nere gave him ſo much as a frown, but mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre the greaſie Fatt, which is inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Monks, ſhe thought 'twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a greaſie ſwaggbelly'd Lover then none at all. 'Twas obſerv'd alſo that ſhe went dreſt more then ſhe was wont to do, when ſhe was to ſee him, and that their Cheek-by-jowles laſted a long while. This half-Inclination laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till ſhe had got her Arms at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it was permitted her to be viſited by Sparks and Gallants of this World. But then ſhe found ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and Monks, that ſhe utterly and without compaſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd the poor and unfortunate <hi>Bernardin,</hi> who was ready to dye for Madneſs. I never ſaw a young Girle ſo wild. She would come ſometimes into the ſpeaking-room, in the Habit of a Nun, with her vaile over her face, and tell thoſe that ſtay'd for her, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Mazarin</hi> was very ill, and could not come to 'em. At other times
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63944:136"/>
ſhe would appear in Man's Apparel with a huge Perriwig and a Hat and Plume of Feathers; and in that diſguiſe would play a thouſand apiſh Tricks, and what ever habit ſhe had on, her wild Humours were ſtill the ſame. She frankly confeſt that the ſight of a Hat rejoyc'd her, and that nothing was ſo Melancholly to her as Company without a Hat. But ſhe told me one day a thing that was much more pleaſant then that. We were tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one day of the exceſſive Devotion of her Father, at which time ſhe never ſcrupl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to call him Fool and Viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and recounted to me, that while the Duke and the Dutcheſs liv'd together, he would never lye with her, before ſhe had repeated a whole Roſary in his preſence, and had been at Prayers with him every Evening upon her Knees, which together with the Litanies of the Virgin, laſted at leaſt an Hour: So that, ſaid ſhe, the poor Lady my Mother, for want of Patience, was often forc'd to go without her Husbands kindneſs.</p>

Gentleman who had no other good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to recommend him, but only that he was the Son of the Preſident of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of that Province: and that was no great matter. For there are ſome of thoſe Preſidents that make no great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: nevertheleſs the buſineſs was gone ſo far that meaſures were taken to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her privately, and get her out of the Convent, over the Walls that joyn to the River, where there was a Bark ready to conveigh the two Lovers to a Bark that was hir'd on purpoſe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 'em into <hi>England,</hi> where the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> protected by the Queen her Kinſwoman had promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This hairbrain'd project was juſt ready to be put in execution, when Providence that takes care of Madfolks and Children, diſappointed the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, by means of the confidence which they put in the Seneſchal of the City, from whom they expected aſſiſtance. He promis'd to lend 'em two thouſand Crowns, and by that means delay'd 'em fifteen days, while he in the mean time gave notice to the Duke, who came Poſt to <hi>Hennebond,</hi> and took his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from thence, not without letting her taſte of his diſpleaſure in the terrible
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63944:137"/>
Reprimands that he gave her. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he carry'd her to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he lockt her up among the Capuchins; hoping ſhe would be there more ſtrictly kept, as being a Houſe that obſerv'd an exact Auſterity, and where there would be always a watchful Eye over her. He alſo moſt devoutly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the cuſtody of the Bleſs'd St. <hi>Clement,</hi> who arriv'd there a little before, and who in all the uſual forms accuſtom'd among the Saints, was to ſignalize his coming by ſome authentick favour. But all theſe precautions prov'd fruitleſs: for the Female Capuchins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a hurry upon the change of their Houſe, could not ſo diligently look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Priſoner but that ſhe ran away with the Marquiſs of <hi>Richlieu;</hi> at leaſt the Monks told the diſpairing D. of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi> ſo, who went to throw himſelf at the Kings feet, &amp; baule out his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune all over the Court: which ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But perhaps he would not have made ſo loud a noiſe had he known the truth of the ſtory, for you muſt know that his good Friend Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> was the occaſion and contriver of it. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

to the Abbeſs of the Convent, and ſpar'd for no pains at this time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her that the Duke of <hi>Mazarin</hi> was a Churle or <hi>Cynic,</hi> that would make his Daughter run mad, if he had her much longer in his keeping. That a Young Lady of her condition was not to be ſo rudely dealt with; and that aſſuredly the leaſt miſchief that could befall her Houſe would be this, that ſhe would diſhonour the Convent by ſome Foppiſh Trick or other: to prevent which, the beſt way would be to marry her privately, and ſend her to her Mother, till the Duke could be brought to hear reaſon, which he would undertake himſelf to do. After which he propos'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> which the Abbes at firſt did not think a ſuitable match; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, ſhe ſubmitted to his Reaſons.

I can ſay nothing as to that, unleſs it were perchance out of his Affection for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Mazarin,</hi> who was his Patron and his Benefactors Neice. It might be alſo that the fifty thouſand Livres which the Marquis of <hi>Richlieu</hi> charg'd upon the Banker <hi>Gruſle,</hi> for his Brother M. <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> might contribute ſomething toward the matter.

               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:63944:139"/>But let us leave theſe trifles, and proceed to Affairs of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. About this time Monſieur <hi>Sebret,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary to <hi>Siam,</hi> return'd home, and with him came Father <hi>Tachart,</hi> a Jeſuit, Ambaſſador from the New Convert, to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. He was accompani'd by eight <hi>Mandarins,</hi> who attended him as his Gentlemen. This Father brought to the King the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Treaty of Alliance made with the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> by virtue of which that Prince ſurrender'd into his hands ſeveral Places of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The <hi>Chevalier Fourbin</hi> return'd alſo in the ſame Veſſel: whoſe too great favour had render'd him odious to M. <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who was afraid of being thrown out of the Saddle by him, and therefore could no longer ſuffer him in Place. So that <hi>Fourbin</hi> was forc'd to give way to the ſtrongeſt, and be gone. But this giving way did not ſatisfie the others Ambitious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful ſpirit. He wrote therefore to Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> upon this Subject, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining highly of <hi>Fourbin,</hi> calling him <hi>Braggadochio</hi> and <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> who ſetting a high value upon himſelf, yet having

a very ſmall Fortune, was more like to ſpoyle then accomodate Affairs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fearing he ſhould not be believ'd upon his word, and that his Majeſty ſhould reſent the ill uſage of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, he engag'd Father <hi>de Fontenay,</hi> Superiour of the Houſe of <hi>Siam,</hi> to write in the ſame ſtile, wherein he ſerv'd <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſo well, that the poor Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, tho Nepew to the Biſhop of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vais,</hi> was glad of a Fregate of twelve Guns, after he had been Admiral of the <hi>Siam</hi> Seas. More then this, they ſeiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This Man was a Grecian by Birth, born at <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> an Iſland belonging to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> of very mean extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho Father <hi>Trachart</hi> will have him to be the Son of the Governour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is much deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His name is <hi>Conſtance Queralcky,</hi> and not <hi>Phancon,</hi> as the ſame Father aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: or if he aſſum'd that name, it was only the better to conceal himſelf. Now in regard he was reduc'd ſo low as to beg Alms, his Mother got him to be a Ship-Boy in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel, where he was inſtructed in the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Afterwards he came to be a common Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and as ſuch a one went to the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> where it was no difficult thing for a young fellow that had wit to get money, with which he traded for himſelf, and in proceſs of time was Conſul for the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> By that means he became known at Court, and particularly at that of the <hi>Baccalon,</hi> or Prime Miniſter of <hi>Siam,</hi> who at the end of his Conſulſhip took him for his Secretary. In that Employment he won the very heart of the <hi>Boccalon,</hi> and he the Affection of the King by his Secretaries management; ſo that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undertake an Ambaſſy at half the expence which the Moors requir'd, he was ſent, and upon his return, the <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calon</hi> being dead, he was preferr'd in his Room. At that time it was, that the Jeſuits perceiving how uſeful he might be to 'em, ceas'd not to haunt him, till they had over rul'd him to

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63944:141"/>
that he ſuffer'd 'em to Convert his Subjects in his very Court; and more then that, he bid 'em not be out of hopes of Converting himſelf. And upon theſe hopes it was, that Father <hi>Couplet,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman</hi> born, was ſent into <hi>France</hi> with two men, who ſtyl'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Mandarins,</hi> to hear what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their Ambaſſadors, tho the King of <hi>Siam</hi> never dreamt of any ſuch thing. This was ſo concerted, to tempt his Majeſty to ſend an Embaſſy thither, which no body could take an oceaſion to comment upon, or tax him from thence for having beg'd the Friendſhip and Alliance of the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Couplet</hi> had long and frequent Conferences with <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> concerning this Enterprize, and ſhew'd him the great advantages that would redound to the Society, which could hope no leſs then to engroſs the greateſt part of the Immenſe Wealth which lies in the Pagods of thoſe Countries. And as for his Majeſty, not to ſpeak of the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it would be to him, to have procur'd the Converſion of a Kingdom ſo far diſtant, he had all the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties imaginable to make himſelf Maſter of it in time, if the King of <hi>Siam</hi> could
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63944:141"/>
be once perſwaded to admit <hi>French</hi> Forces into his Country, upon pretence of defending him againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> after they had once perſwaded him that they were his mortal Enemies, who only ſought an occaſion to poure themſelves into his Country and compleat the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of it; the buſineſs of <hi>Bantam</hi> very much aſſiſting 'em to make him give credit to their Story. The Father ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that this deſign would be ſo much the more eaſie to the King, in regard the <hi>Indians</hi> being nothing near ſo well train'd in War as the <hi>Europians,</hi> they could not make any formidable reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, unleſs they were firſt inſtructed and exerciz'd by the <hi>French</hi> who were perfectly skill'd in military Diſcipline. But in regard the King was a Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Generous, and who made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown the only mark of all his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, it might be readily believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

advantage by this means, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Thorn in the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſides, and ſo ſettle a good Trade for his own Subiects. However certain it is, that if the King undertakes this buſineſs, he will prove more ſucceſsful then. I dare promiſe to my ſelf.

            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who ſuſpected the worſt, engag'd Sultan <hi>Agni,</hi> King of <hi>Bantam</hi> to refuſe the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador all manner of Audience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or Harbour in his Ports, and to ſend

               </gap>d that it was contrary to the Laws of the Land and their own Conſciences, were ſent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and orders given to proceed againſt 'em according to Law. The King therefore finding he could not compaſs his ends this way, took another
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63944:143"/>
courſe; which was to ſend Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners all over <hi>England</hi> in order to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people and Magiſtrates to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this new Impoſition. But they returning and declaring to the King the little inclination which they found in the People to ſo great a Change, and that they did not believe that any of the Juſtices of the Peace would conſent to it, the King enter'd into a deſign of laying aſide all the Magiſtrates in the Kingdom, that refus'd to yield him O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in this particlar. As bold a Project, as ever was; but in my opinion not to be compar'd with the raſhneſs of the means which he went about to make uſe of, to bring it to paſs. He knew he could not do this unleſs he had a good Army on Foot, ready, and in a condition to ſecond his commands, and in which he might confide. This was a Gordian Knot: but he thought to have cut it eaſily, by forcing all the Officers to change their Religion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Fleet, which he thought would be of more uſe to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he began to ſend his Monks and Prieſts on board the Men of War, with orders to ſay Maſs: which they went roundly about to have done: but the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63944:144"/>
Seamen all in an uproar, preſently ſeiz'd upon their perſons and would have thrown 'em over board, had not their Officers interpos'd their authority to ſave thoſe miſerable Creatures, who were ſent packing out of the danger. The King of <hi>England</hi> judging advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly of the defference and reſpect of the Officers upon this occaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to make the beſt of it. To that purpoſe he went aboard the Admiral, and order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d all the Officers to bring their Commiſſions thither. After which he declar'd to 'em all, that it was his pleaſure that they ſhould quit their old Hereſie and embrace the Roman Catholick Religion. To which the Officers made this reſolute anſwer; that they were ready to obey him in all thoſe things that were juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but that they would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Conſciences. The King would fain have perſwaded 'em that what he requir'd of 'em was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to Juſtice nor Religion, and that he had no other aim then to procure the ſalvation of their Souls. But finding he could not bring his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign about, he declar'd to 'em that he would give 'em no longer than twenty
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63944:144"/>
four hours to conſider of it; after which, he would take away the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of all ſuch as would not obey his orders, and ſo away he went. However finding 'em as reſolute as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the time expir'd, he told em 'twas an Affair of two great importance to be reſolv'd in ſo ſhort a time, and therefore he granted a longer reſpit. I muſt confeſs I cannot comprehend what King <hi>James</hi> thought of himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take an Affair of this nature in ſo ſhort a time, and with ſo much huffing Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs. How! — in ſix Months to ſtuff his Capital City with Monks and Fryars; to take away the Colleges of <hi>Oxford</hi> from the Proteſtants; to ſettle the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in their Churches! Give <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience,</hi> aboliſh the Teſt and Penal Laws, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Touchſtone of their Religion! Impriſon their Biſhops, for whom they have ſo high a Reverence! Threaten the Magiſtrates to turn 'em out of their Places! and laſtly to order all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Officers to change their Religion in 24 hours upon pain of looſing their Commiſſions; and himſelf to go aboard the Men of War, in the midſt of 'em, to give his commands, in Perſon, at a
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63944:145"/>
time when he was hatching to impoſe a ſuſpected Prince upon em, is that which Poſterity will hardly believe. He muſt needs be a great Enemy to his Repoſe and his Grandeur, who labour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d after this manner to ruin both. Who ever drove the Chariot of Arbitrary Power thus <hi>Jehu</hi>-like? The <hi>Moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> King, who perhaps has done as much as any other before him, durſt never carry it ſo high. But King <hi>James</hi> thought himſelf to be a <hi>Hercules,</hi> a <hi>Mars,</hi> who was able of himſelf to ſubdue a whole Nation. Now if he had continu'd to make good this character of Authority and Undauntedneſs, we ſhould have ſaid that all this had proceeded from a Courage truly Heroick; but he flagg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While theſe things were thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in <hi>England,</hi> they were preparing for War in <hi>France.</hi> For the Pope had granted a Bull to diſpence with Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Barvaria</hi>'s Age; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was the moſt formidable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with Cardinal <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> 'twas

               </gap>d in the Chapter of <hi>Cologne;</hi> more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially becauſe the Pope oppos'd the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus the Buſineſs of the <hi>Franchiſes,</hi> that ſignify'd nothing in the Main, was at length very prejudicial to the King: for he drave it on with that Paſſion, that he forgot the Cardinals Intereſts which were more ſubſtantially his own. And tho the Cardinal had often enough im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd his aid, and frequently written to <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> about it, he never thought it worth his time to hearken to him, till the Pope had granted Prince <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> a Diſpenſation. But then the King reflecting ſeverely what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage the advancement of the Cardinal would be to him, began to think of it in good Earneſt, and to that purpoſe wrote a ſubmiſſive Letter to the Pope, which he order'd the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>d' Eſtree</hi> to deliver to him. He alſo made very advantageous offers to <hi>Ranonci,</hi> the Popes Nuncio upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his Holineſs would give his confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to Cardinal <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> and take no notice of Prince <hi>Clement.</hi> But the Pope, who could not rely upon the King, conſidering the affrontive uſage which he had receiv'd at his hands, remain'd
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63944:146"/>
inexorable, and had the ſatisfaction to ſee himſelf ſought to with as much reſpect, as before he had been treated with diſdain and contempt. In ſhort, whithin a few days after he gave out a Bull of Eligibility for the young Prince, not having vouchſaf'd ſo much as to ſee or to hear the Agents for Cardinal <hi>Furſtenburgd.</hi> He alſo forbid his Envoy to ſtile himſelf from that time forward <hi>Agent for the Elector of</hi> Cologne. Who finding that he could not be admitted to Audience, caus'd Placarts to be ſet up in all the Corners of the Streets, containing an Appeal to a future Council, in the name of his Maſter, againſt the Abuſive Proceedings of the Pope. But the Cardinal knew that if he ſtay'd for juſtice to be done him by the future Council, he might wait long enough for that which would come too late.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time news was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of the election of the Baron <hi>d Elderen</hi> to the Biſhoprick &amp; Principality of <hi>Liege,</hi> of the Baron of <hi>Plettenburgh</hi> to that of <hi>Munſter;</hi> who both ſent to the Pope, to deſire their confirmations, which were forthwith granted 'em accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

In ſo much that he told him in very harſh language, that never any buſineſs that was manag'd by a Jeſuit came to good: And that it would be better for em to mind their <hi>Paedagoging</hi> in their Schools, then to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with State Affairs. After which he was above a month before he would ſo much as ſpeak to him again; ſo that the Father thought himſelf loſt forever.</p>
            <p>He came to Madam <hi>Maintenon</hi> all in an Alarum, importunately beſeeching her to ſpeak to the King in his behalf,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63944:147"/>

            <p>In the mean time great Preparations were made for the War on every ſide.

And in regard he was inform'd of new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and new Cabals to their prejudice, he was no leſs deſirous to let 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Sentiments in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>This was the Declaration of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, by which it may be ſeen, that the King was not abſolutely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> deſign; at leaſt that his ſuſpitions were conformable to the truth. Nevertheleſs, through a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which I apprehend ſo much the leſs, becauſe it is not uſual for that Prince to be guilty of ſuch failings, he heard the Thunder grumble, and ſaw the Arm juſt lifted up to ſtrike, without taking any juſt meaſures to ward off the Blow: and upon this occaſion where there was no need of any more then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Light of common Sence, to guard himſelf from the danger that threaten'd him, it ſeem'd as if he had been well pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But inſtead of this, the King allurd by the certain hopes of taking two or three Places, not able to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſnapt at that Bait, and ſent away the <hi>Dauphin</hi> with a mighty Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conquer a pitiful Nook of Land, while on the other ſide the Prince of

            <p>By what I have ſaid 'tis apparent, that the end of that year was fatal to two Kings: nevertheleſs, when the <hi>Dauphin</hi> return'd to Court he was overwhelm'd with Congratulations.

All which was viſible by his having ſo violently ſupported, and by his ſtill ſupporting the intereſt of the Regale, and by his connivence, or to ſay more truly, by the ſhare which he had in the the injurious and raſh proceedings of <hi>France</hi> againſt the Holy See: which if nothing elſe, was ſufficient to exclude

with others in the choice of a General of their own Nation, which had no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the General elected.

            <p>This diviſion happening in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus made a great noiſe; and no body queſtion'd but there would be very ſuddainly two great Schiſms in the Church: the one General, by a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, which threaten'd a National Council; and other particular of the <hi>French</hi> Jeſuits, who were about to make a Body by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, nothing of this fell out; for as to the firſt, every body knows the reaſon; the Pope dy'd, and his Succeſſor proving a very good <hi>French</hi> man, the <hi>French</hi> never ſcrupl'd to acknowlegde him.

            <p>In the firſt is to be diſcover'd that fundamental opinion of the Society, which is the Source of all their irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities.

               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:63944:159"/>When the Father firſt receiv'd the news, he was then with the King, and as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick as he was, he could not moderate the exceſs of his joy. Yet fearing to diſplay it too apparently before the King, he withdrew a little to recover himſelf, and at the ſame inſtant met the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> But then it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to contain himſelf any longer. <hi>A thouſand Piſtoles,</hi> ſaid he, accoaſting <hi>him, and your Benediction, for the news which I have to tell you. As for my Benediction,</hi> reply'd the Archbiſhop, <hi>there it is, and as for the thouſand Piſtoles, they are always ready at your ſervice: but then keep me no longer in ſuſpence; let me know what your news is.

Do you tell me true,</hi> quoth the Prelate interrupting him. <hi>I tell you nothing but truth,</hi> reply'd the Father. They held on this converſation the ſame tone above a quarter of an hour, in the Guard Chamber, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated each other a thouſand times over, upon their approaching promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Cardinalſhip, never minding

all this while the Guards of the Body and about fifty other Perſons that heard every word they ſaid; ſuch were the tranſports of their exultation. At length perceiving their error, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Kings Chamber.</p>
            <p>Preſently the King appointed another Ambaſſador for <hi>Rome,</hi> who was the Duke of <hi>Chaulnes,</hi> and who departed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, together with the Cardinals of <hi>Furſtenburgh, Bonzi</hi> and <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to be in time at the Conclave.

days after, tho he had deſign'd him Commander of the Order, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he well deſerves to be. So ſoon as the Conclave began to ſit, the Cardinals enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eight days after that, the Duke of <hi>Chaulnes</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> with the French Cardinals, and upon his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Cardinals advice of his arrival, he was viſited, admitted to Audience, and acknowledg'd Ambaſſador, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of their Proteſtations.</p>

For the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> having made his Party as numerous as he could, tho it was hardly ſufficient to have voted the Excluſion of any other,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63944:161"/>
ſally'd out of his Chamber, and ran about the Conclave, crying ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the firſt Congregation which this new Pope held, he releas'd to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> in acknowledgement of the ſervice he had done him, the ſum of 30000 Livres which he ow'd the Apoſtolik Chamber, and gave him the Biſhoprick of <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Honour allow'd to none but ſoveraign Princes.</p>
            <p>1690. And upon his importanate Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations it was that he granted a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Cap to the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais.</hi> Tis true, he had a great deal of trouble to obtain it, and that he deſpair'd of it above four times. For I my ſelf have ſeen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters which he wrote to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> upon that ſubject, wherein he had ſtill theſe Expreſſions, <hi>I do what I can, but know not whither I ſhall ſucceed or no: However I promiſe ye not to give over, till his Holineſs abſolutely forbids me to ſpeak no more of it.</hi> He alſo took a world of Pains to make him grant his Bulls, and was the firſt that had one.</p>
            <p>So many favours granted for his ſake by his Holineſs, deſervedly requir'd that he ſhould do ſomething a freſh for the Holy See. To that purpoſe he perſwaded the King to ſatisfie the Pope upon the Affairs of the Franchiſes, and to ſurrender his pretentions freely; of which Tydings he was the Meſſenger himſelf from the Duke of <hi>Chaulnes.</hi> At which his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſo overjoy'd, that he promis'd the Cardinal at the ſame inſtant, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſuccour King <hi>James</hi> with Money, and in ſhort, ſeem'd to be altogether en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63944:162"/>
to take part with <hi>France.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Furſtenbergh</hi> alſo, making the beſt of his Opportunity, demanded a Review of the Affairs of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and in a word the Pope order'd an Aſſembly of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to meet at Sieur <hi>di Ervaux</hi>'s, the Auditor of the <hi>Rota's</hi> Houſe; but not with that ſucceſs as was deſir'd. For the Bulls granted to Prince <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. were confirm'd. Which the Cardinal took ſo hainouſly, that fearing withal, leſt the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſhould put ſome ſcurvy trick upon him in a place where he thought himſelf not very ſecure, he decamp'd by the Advice of <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> who ſent him a Letter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> and accept of the Abby of St. <hi>Germans de Prez,</hi> which the King beſtow'd upon him at his arrival.</p>
            <p>But the Capitulars of <hi>Cologne,</hi> that were of his Party, would not deſiſt for all this: they took a journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Pope to reſtore 'em to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonſhips and Benefices. The Pope lent 'em a favourable Ear, and us'd his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours very ſtrenuouſly with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> to that effect. But all to no purpoſe; for they wrote ſo effectually to the Cardinal <hi>de Medicis</hi> Protector of the Affairs of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:63944:162"/>
beſeeching his Holineſs not to trouble 'em any more about that Affair, that he was forc'd to give it over. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, in <hi>April</hi> following, he took off all the Interdictions and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications that had been thunder'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe outed Prieſts, and admitted all their Appeals in reference to every thing that had been acted againſt them to their prejudice. Theſe things aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd many People, and much more the Nomination of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to the dignity of Cardinal, to which the Pope gave his Conſent. For till then, that Prelate was thought a perſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever excluded from that preferment; and <hi>Paſquin</hi> had ſaid a long time before, <hi>That the Archbiſhop of</hi> Paris <hi>had ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Holy See, but he would never bluſh for it.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Reims</hi> had not the ſame advantage, and tho he had been nothing near ſo obſtinate in oppoſing the Pope, nevertheleſs he had the vexatious misfortune to ſee his rival and hated Competitour preferr'd before him.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Pope was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Right of the Franchiſes, which was conceded to him; he vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted for ſatisfaction in reference to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63944:163"/>
the Aſſembly in 82. and the Proceedings that enſu'd upon it. On the other ſide, the King, who was unwilling to give him a Repulſe, in hopes to gain the Bulls for his Biſhops, and ſome other Favours more, made a ſhew of acquieſcing willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſummon'd an Aſſembly of the Clergy; but this was only to amuſe the Old Gentleman. Nay, he enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more particular Negotiation, and receiv'd a Project of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was brought him in his Holineſſes Name by the Abbot of <hi>Polig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac;</hi> and appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was as much as to ſay, that they meant not to come to any Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for what Expedient could they ever think of unleſs it were a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Twas not to be imagin'd that the Holy See would ever be ſatisfi'd with leſs; and that's a Thing, which I am apt to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63944:163"/>
believe the King will never endure ſo long as he lives. And it is apparent that the Pope underſtood him in that ſence; ſeeing that finding himſelf ſurpriz'd by Death before he could bring this Affair to a concluſion; he thunder'd out, upon his very death-bed, a Bull, that cancells, diſannuls and condemns as bold and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous the Deciſions of that Aſſembly about the Regale, and the four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions maintain'd againſt the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Holy See. This was a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclap to the King, which he never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> therefore, who had no more kindneſs for this Pope then for his Predeceſſour, was plain with the K. in theſe words, <hi>I have foretold it more then once, that Your Majeſty was not to expect any good from this Knave of a Pope. I knew him at</hi> Rome, <hi>when he was no more then a bare Prieſt, and one that bedaggl'd his Caſſock with trotting from morning till night to the Houſes of the Prelates of</hi> Rome, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe favour he inſinuated himſelf by carrying 'em the News of the Town. He was a kind of familiar Spie, who was no ſooner gone out of one Houſe, but he went to another to tell what he had ſeen and heard. I never knew a Perſon of ſuch a double heart, or of ſuch a Treacherous Soul.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63944:164"/>
ſtill continuing his diſcourſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd after that, to render the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſuſpected to the King, by putting it into his Head, that he had not done him ſo great a piece of ſervice as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd by raiſing that Man to the Holy See: and talking of the extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he had paid to the Prince of <hi>Turrenne,</hi> and of the 10000 Crowns he had given him, he ſought to infuſe into him, that the Pope and the Cardinal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood one another. But that Hook did not take with the King; nor was he known to look upon the Cardinal with a leſs favourable Eye for <hi>la Chaiſes</hi> Story.</p>

Chambre,</hi> you very much ſhorten'd your way. But in regard that Cooks were the moſt dangerous of all, they were the beſt us'd. I know one that left his Service about five Years ago, after he had got vaſt ſums of Money. When he deſired of <hi>M. Louvois</hi> that he might have leave to quit his Service, he told his Maſter, that having the Honour to ſerve him ten or a dozen Years, he had gain'd an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſufficient to maintain him, and therefore he would be glad to take his eaſe, if he might have his permiſſion to retire, and that he would reſign his place to ſome poor honeſt Fellow that was in neceſſity. <hi>M. Louvois</hi> return'd him anſwer, That he was very glad he had done his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gave him leave; promiſing him withal his Protection as long as he liv'd. This man was no ſooner out of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but nothing would ſerve him but to ſet up for a Lord, even in <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, without ſeeking to go any further. And the beautiful Houſe of the deceaſed <hi>M. de Bizeul,</hi> being to be ſold, he out-bid the Count <hi>d' Eſtampes</hi> ten thouſand Livres, who offer'd ſixty thouſand Crowns for it. The Count being offended at ſuch a diſappointment, complain'd to the King, who ſeverely rebuk'd M. <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and told him 'twas a crying ſhame that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63944:165"/>
ſhould go out of his Houſe ſo rich, as to bid for Purchaſes that few Dukes and Peers were in a condition to cope with. Upon which, the Marquis of <hi>Louvois</hi> ſent for his Cook the next day, and gave him ſuch a rattle as he deſerv'd. But this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is dead, and M. <hi>de Pompone</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd and put in his Place, which made F. <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> ready to eat his Fingers for madneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Twas in vain for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the man who had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Secrets, would never ſerve him faithfully, but that he was every way to be ſuſpected; for the King knowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what grounds he ſpoke, gave little or no heed to what he ſaid. Beſides, he begins to underſtand the revengeful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Man, and ſince the Affair of the Franchiſes and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Leige</hi> better inſtructed him, he hearkens not ſo much to him as he was wont to do, where any one is concern'd for whom he has no kindneſs. More then this, he has had the misfortune to fail in ſeveral Enterpriſes, which the King never natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lov'd. (1690.) Lately he miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in one of his own contriving; which was a Conſpiracy at <hi>Turin;</hi> which was to have had that City betray'd to the <hi>French,</hi> and which was carry'd on by the Jeſuits

of that Place, who had receiv'd a great part of the Money to gain the Traytors: but the Treaſon being diſcover'd, all came to nothing. When I ſay it was of <hi>la Chaiſe</hi>'s contrivance, I do not aſſert it for a truth, but upon the Report which was then ſpread abroad in <hi>Paris,</hi> and they nam'd one Father <hi>Campo,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> who made ſeveral journeys from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Turin</hi> for that purpoſe.

            <p>The next Year, the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had diſcover'd the ſecret Treaty which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had concluded with the Emperor and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> earneſtly preſt that Prince to declare himſelf, or if he would continue ſtill a <hi>Neuter,</hi> (1690.) to put into his hands, for the aſſurance of his Word, the Citadel of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63944:167"/>
               <hi>Turin, Verue,</hi> and <hi>Verceil:</hi> To which the Duke had no mind to conſent; becauſe he knew it would have viſibly ſubjected him under the power of a Maſter, who has not the Reputation of being very tractable. Conſtrain'd therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve one thing or other, he choſe the beſt courſe, I mean, the leaſt evil of the two. For in that Conjuncture, he had no choice to make that was poſitively good. And in the ſhort time of his entring into the War, he had experimentally found, by the loſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> how unfortunate a weak Prince is, whoſe Territories ſerve as a Barrier between two potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs. Till then, all things ſucceeded the beſt that could be for the King. He had been victorious at Sea againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were reduc'd to ſuch an unhappy Condition, that hardly a Ship had eſcap'd, had not the Night favor'd their Retreat. 'Tis true, that tho' in that Engagement the <hi>French</hi> Pleet had all the Advantage, the <hi>Dutch</hi> won all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For I believe 'twas never known, that Two and twenty Men of War ſhould fight ſo long, and ſo furiouſly, againſt a Fleet of above Fourſcore Sail, while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, under the Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> lookt on all the while, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:63944:168"/>In <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> had defeated Prince <hi>Waldeck;</hi> at which time the <hi>Confederates</hi> loſt above 5000 Men, not counting in the Priſoners, of which there were a great Number.</p>
            <p>But, in the Concluſion, what uſe did the <hi>French</hi> make of theſe Victories? Did they take one Town in <hi>Flanders?</hi> Did they make any Attempt upon <hi>England?</hi> Nothing of all this: only the Chevalier <hi>Tourville</hi> burnt two or three Fiſhermens Cottages, and then, as proud as an Aſs of a new Packſaddle, return'd for <hi>Breſt,</hi> to be Complimented for it. King <hi>William</hi> taught 'em another Leſſon. He knew better how to make His Advantage of His Victory over K. <hi>James,</hi> or rather, over <hi>Tyrcennel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun.</hi> For as for K. <hi>James,</hi> he had packt up his Baggage, ſo ſoon as he ſaw the Combat grow warm. He's not ſo improvident to thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Army in the heat of a Fight: 'tis a little too much for common Nature to endure. However it were, King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> having paſs'd the <hi>Boyne,</hi> in deſpite of His Enemies; and, which was worſe, having put 'em to the Rout, made Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Drogheda, Dundalk, Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Waterford,</hi> &amp;c. And had not foul weather come on too faſt, had taken <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:63944:168"/>
their laſt Retreat. But the Conqueſt of that City was reſerv'd till the next Year; for the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi> who took it <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. 1691. and granted the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Mr. <hi>Boeſſelot</hi> very honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>This laſt Misfortune threw K. <hi>James</hi> into utmoſt Conſternation, ſo that he knew not what meaſures to take. He often bewail'd himſelf to Father <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> whom he could not chuſe but look upon as one of the principal Artificers of his Misfortune, tho' he would not ſeem to take notice of it. <hi>What ſhall I do, and what will become of me,</hi> ſaid he to him one day, tranſported with grief, <hi>unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince as I am? Chac'd from my Kingdoms, hated by my Subjects, abandon'd by all the World, and pity'd by No Body. Oh! how dear has my Eaſineſs coſt me!</hi> added he, caſting a wiſtful Look upon the Father, wherein there was much to be read: <hi>It has coſt me my Crown, my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Repoſe of my Life.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Father, who ſhar'd in his grief as much as his Nature would give him leave, promis'd him to ſet all the moſt hidden Springs of the Jeſuitical Engine at work, and that the whole Society ſhould burn their Books, or reſtore him to his
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63944:169"/>
Throne. <hi>Only,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>'tis your Majeſties buſineſs to be willing to be ſerv'd; do but concur never ſo little with us, and you ſhall ſee a ſudden Turn of your Affairs. We have more then one String to our Bow: And if hitherto the Lyon's Skin has not been ſufficient to cover us, we muſt ſowe the Fox's Skin to it.</hi> And indeed, he kept ſo effectually to his word, that if Providence, that watches over things below, had not diſappointed the pernicious deſigns of his Cabal, we had ſeen another Revolution, at leaſt as ſtrange as the former. The Jeſuits therefore were order'd to take the Field, and furniſh'd with good Letters of Exchange, away they hurry'd into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where joining with thoſe that ſtill lay lurking in that Kingdom, and who intreagu'd them with the principal <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> they hatch'd that terrible Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, wherein 'twas ſaid ſo many Lords and Perſons of all Conditions were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd, and which tended only to introduce the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo reſtore K. <hi>James</hi> to his Throne: which had that been all, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it had been excuſable in ſuch as thought they ow'd their Allegiance to no other Soveraign; but they had ſuborn'd a Company of Hell-born Ruffians, who were

to have aſſaſſinated King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> while others at the ſame time were to have ſeiz'd the Perſon of the <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EEN;</hi> to whom perhaps they would have given no better Quarter.</p>
            <p>When this Conſpiracy was brought to perfection, and that the Jeſuits were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of their People, Father <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> gave advice to K <hi>James,</hi> and told him, <hi>That now it was his time to act.</hi> I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs 'tis too true, that he did conſent at laſt, and that he perſuaded the King of <hi>France</hi> to conſent alſo, notwithſtanding his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd abomination of Parricides.

He told 'em, <hi>There was nothing more uncertain then the Succeſs of their Deſign, and that he had Employment enough for his Men to guard
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63944:170"/>
his own Dominions.</hi> But F. <hi>la Chaiſe</hi> and <hi>Lauſun</hi> giving him to underſtand, that it was the ſureſt way to ſtop King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> and hinder the Deſcent, with which he threaten'd <hi>France,</hi> he ſubmitted to their Importunities; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, there was nothing diſcours'd of in <hi>France,</hi> but of the great Fleet that was ſetting out for K. <hi>James.</hi> True it is, it was conſiderable enough to have giv'n King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> ſome trouble, and to have let the <hi>Confederates</hi> have known that <hi>France</hi> was not in ſo low a condition as many People believ'd ſhe was.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1692"/> Four hunder'd Tranſport Ships were taken up for the embarking of 20000 Men, as well Horſe as Foot, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all ſorts of warlike Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as Powder, Bullets, Cannon, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Bombs, Pickaxes, Ladders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Fleet was to have been guarded by twelve great Men of War, commanded by the Duke <hi>d'Eſtree,</hi> who had fitted 'em out at <hi>Toulon.</hi> In the mean time, to favor the Deſcent, and hinder any Succor that could come from <hi>Holland,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> had Orders to cruiſe in the Channel with a Fleet of above a hunder'd Sail; and all this was ready in leſs then two

months time. So that upon the 29th of <hi>April,</hi> K. <hi>James,</hi> who was arriv'd at <hi>la Hogue,</hi> began to embark his Men, after he had carefully viſited all the Ships of Burden; and three days after they were ready to ſet Sail, only they ſtay'd for <hi>d'Eſtree</hi>'s Squadron, and a favourable Wind. But he being ſurpriz'd by violent Storms, that threw two of his great Men of War upon the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and very much ſhatter'd others, could not poſſibly obſerve his time.</p>
            <p>Some Weeks before, K. <hi>James</hi> had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He alſo wrote a Letter to the Officers and Seamen aboard the Fleet, promiſing 'em the full payment of their Arrears,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63944:171"/>
and to continue 'em in their employment. Together with another to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, inviting 'em to <hi>Paris,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Queen his Wife's Labour: for the removing all the Suſpitions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all the falſe reports which his Enemies had rais'd touching the Birth of his Son, whom he call'd, <hi>Prince of Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However this Letter wrought upon very few, and in all probability they that went loſt their labour too; for the Queen was brought to Bed ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who was order'd by the King to be at her Delivery, could not come time enough, tho ſhe drove with all ſpeed from St. <hi>Clou,</hi> ſo ſoon as ſhe had notice of it; which put ſome jealouſies into that Princeſſe's Head.</p>
            <p>Thus all King <hi>James</hi>'s Hopes were blaſted in the bud, and at a time when they promiſed ſo fair. For his Fleet was in the beſt condition in the world: his men luſty and bonny; he wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Neceſſary Ammunition, even to the Spade and Mattock.

attended with Storms and Tempeſts ſo furious, as wrack'd a good part of his Veſſels upon the Coaſts. Which gave the Queen of <hi>England</hi> time ſo diſcover the Conſpiracy: who immediately with an extraordinary prudence gave out all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Orders for preventing the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, as well by impriſoning the chief Conſpirators here, as by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming all ſuſpected Perſons.

            <p>The Jeſuits were aſtoniſh'd when the News arriv'd in <hi>France.</hi> They had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their meaſures ſo exactly, that they thought it impoſſible they could ever miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; yet ſaw the terrible diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their lewd Contrivances, to the eternal ſhame and ignominy of the Complotters.</p>

            <p>That which happen'd upon this occaſion at <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> is very remarkable. There arriv'd in that City out of <hi>France</hi> a certain Benedictin Monk, with a deſign, as he ſaid, to turn Proteſtant. The firſt man to whom he addreſt himſelf was M. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieux,</hi> a Miniſter well known to all the world, to whom he made known a deſire of embracing his Religion. <hi>Jurieux,</hi> who preſently ſuſpected him to be ſome fickle-headed Fellow, that had quitted his Order, only to withdraw himſelf from the Auſterities to which it obliges him, in hopes to get ſome Penſion from the States, as it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens, made him anſwer, That he could not be too much commended; but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd him to be careful of doing any thing unadviſeably in a Buſineſs wherein he could not deceive God, without miſerably deceiving himſelf. The Monk reply'd <hi>That it was not a thing which he had but lately conſider'd of; That, God be thanked, he had knowledge and diſcretion enough,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63944:173"/>
to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood; And that at laſt, after he made Religion his Study for many Years, he was convinc'd, that the</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſignifi'd nothing, but the</hi> Reformed <hi>was the only Proſeſſion of Faith wherein a man could be ſav'd:</hi> And to ſhew that he ſpoke not without Book, he preſently alledg'd to him ſeveral ſolid Arguments.</p>
            <p>In this Poſture things continu'd for ſome days, till Monſieur <hi>Jurieux,</hi> deſirous to ſound the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his heart, touch'd him in the moſt ſenſible part, and ask'd him what courſe of Life he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live, when he had made a publick Cenfeſſion of his Faith? For in ſhort, <hi>ſaid the Miniſter to him,</hi> there is nothing more commonly done in this Country by People of your Coat, and the State is ſo burthen'd with the vaſt number of <hi>Refugees,</hi> that they have much a do to relieve 'em, ſo that you muſt adviſe with your ſelf how to provide for an honeſt Livelihood, either by the labour of your hands, or by ſome other way. The Monk reply'd, <hi>That that Conſideration never needed to trouble him, for he came not to be a Burthen to the Church; for that he had wherewithal to maintain himſelf.</hi> Which very much ſtartl'd Monſieur <hi>Jurieux,</hi> who could not apprehend how a Monk that quitted his Convent to change his Religion, could have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſubſiſt, with out begging; and began to ſuſpect him for a Spy. Which the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, confeſs'd ingeniouſly, to undeceive him, <hi>That before he fled the Convent, he had found out a way to rob the Community of a conſiderable. Sum of Money, and to bring it along with him. My Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>gave 'em a great deal of Money when I took the Habit upon me againſt my Will, and I thought I might with a ſafe Conſcience make my ſelf Maſter of what was my own.</hi> This free Confeſſion ſurpriz'd

               </gap>re, who after that, had never any good opinion of him. But he had far worſe ſentiments of him ſome few days after, when the Miniſter put it a little too cloſe upon him: <hi>It behoves me,</hi> Sir ſaid he, <hi>to tell you all; nor could I think to whom better to make my addreſſes then your ſelf. I have a deſign to deliver the Church of God from the greateſt Tyrant that ever was upon the Earth. Jurieux,</hi> aſtoniſh'd, ask'd him what deliverance and what Tyrant he meant? The King of <hi>France,</hi> reply'd the Monk, <hi>whom I will kill with my own hands, provided I may have that incouragement in this Country which I expect.</hi> M. <hi>Jurieux</hi> trembl'd at the Propoſal, and repuls'd him with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, asking him where he learnt that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ever authoriz'd Aſſaſſinates? telling him with all it was the Doctrine of the Schools from whence he came, but that the <hi>Reformed</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhor'd, as Traytors and Villains, thoſe that taught or practis'd it, and ſo ſaying thruſt him out a Dores. He was no ſooner gone, but in came a friend of M. <hi>Jurieux</hi>'s, who perceiving him in ſome diſorder ask'd him the reaſon of ſo much unwonted diſturbance in his Countenance: He thereupon told him in ſhort the ſtory, as it lay. Upon which his friend put him in mind of the error he had committed in not ſtopping the Fellow, admoniſhing him, that it was a matter of great conſequence. So that M. <hi>Jurieux,</hi> upon ſecond thoughts, acquainted the Sheriffs with it, who committed the wretch to Priſon the ſame Evening. After that, the States wrote to the King of <hi>France</hi> and gave him information of the tragical deſign which the infamous Ruffian had projected; aſſuring him with all, that tho they were at Wars with his Majeſty, yet they were ſo far from approving any
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63944:174"/>
thing ſo wicked and Treacherous, that they were ready to inflict the utmoſt ſeverity of Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the propoſer. To which purpoſe they thought it their duty, to detain the Traytor, till they knew his Majeſties farther pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This was altogether Generous, Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and merits Immortality among men of worth and Virtue: but the Advice was not receiv'd as it ought to have been. So f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r from that, that M. <hi>de Montauzier,</hi> to whom the Letter was directed, return'd an anſwer, as harſh and ſurly, as it ought to have been obliging. For he ſent 'em word, <hi>That the King ſo little minded Parricides, and thoſe that diſclos'd 'em, that he knew very well, that if they could have attempted any thing againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they would have done it long ago; but that, thanks be to God, he had a good Guard that ſecur'd him from that danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am at my wits end, when I conſider that ſuch an Anſwer ſhould come from a King ſo Great and Generous, and for whom I have ſo much love and reſpect. Should it have been ſent from the King of the Wild <hi>Arabs,</hi> or the <hi>Kan</hi> of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> I ſhould not have wondr'd; but from a <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King!</hi> It vexes me to the Soul. This is doing Virtue little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have ſtay'd ſomewhat long upon this Point; to ſhew that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> quite diſgrace and ſhame <hi>France,</hi> which at all times has produc'd theſe Monſters, and Courtiers that ſollicit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage 'em, as we have lately ſeen in the buſineſs of <hi>Granval.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is the greateſt wonder as to that Conſpiracy, is, that the Jeſuits appear not to have
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63944:174"/>
any hand in it. That the Criminal, who charg'd ſeveral conſiderable Perſons, in his Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſays not one word againſt them, which makes many People believe, that they were no way concern'd in it. But I that know the humour and the morals of thoſe Fathers, know what I have reaſon to think. There is a <hi>French</hi> Proverb that ſays, a Workman is known by his Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and it can never be better appli'd then to this occaſion. That piece of Villany came infallibly out of their Shop. And indeed to whom can it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attributed then to people who have render'd themſelves famous by ſeveral attempts of the ſame Nature; and have compos'd whole Books to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Legality</hi> of Aſſaſſinating <hi>Heretick Kings.</hi> Add to this, M. <hi>de Maintenon</hi> is <hi>la Chaiſes</hi> intimate, and ſhe good Woman would hardly have conſented to ſuch a peice of Treachery, without the Fathers privity and advice. Beſide the furious deſire that he and his Society have to reinthrone a Prince, who only loſt himſelf by adhearing ſo much to their Counſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s. The Jeſuit <hi>la Chaiſe,</hi> adove all, is the moſt capable of ſuch a deſign, and I ſhall never forget an interlocutary diſcourſe between him and the Duke of <hi>Coaſlin,</hi> with which I will conclude my Book. 'Twas a little after the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had declar'd againſt the <hi>French.</hi> The Duke was remonſtrating to him, how much the <hi>Confederates</hi> were ſuperiour in Number, the loſſes ſuſtain'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the little likelihood of long maintaining the War with ſuch an inequality of Forces. For in ſhort ſaid he Reverend Father, the King makes his laſt Efforts at the beginning of the War, he has laid Tax upon Tax, Impoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Impoſt; he has created an infinite number of Offices never heard of before. The Communities
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63944:175"/>
and Corporations, as well Eccleſiaſtick as Secular, have contributed ſeveral times beyond their ſtrength: in ſhort, they have pillag'd the Altars, and diſpoil'd 'em of all their Ornaments. Tell me ſeriouſly Father do you believe, that <hi>France</hi> is an inexhauſtible Mine of Money? No, without doubt, the bottom will diſcloſe it ſelf ſooner then you think for; and then it will come to paſs, that the King being no longer able to pay his men, nor to defray the prodigious expence he is forc'd to be at, as well by Sea as by Land, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee the <hi>Germans</hi> come and preſs the Vinta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our <hi>Campagne</hi> Grapes, while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the other ſide invading our Coaſts, deſpoil and ranſack all our lovely Provinces, that for ſo many years have not known what War means. <hi>We are not come to that yet,</hi> reply'd the Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, <hi>and before that come to paſs, there are a great many Engins that will be ſet at work. I believe it,</hi> reply'd the Duke, <hi>but our miſchiefs, it may be, will befall us, before they have done working; in that caſe,</hi> Father, <hi>What ſecret will you find out, to expel 'em from our Territories?</hi> What ſecret? <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Father in a heat, you are too haſty, hold a little, there is ſtill a remedy for all things, good Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur le Duke; and let one word ſuffice for all, that if the King of Spain were dead, 'twould be no difficult thing to divide this formidable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which you ſtand ſo much in dread of.</hi> I leave it to the judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others, what he meant by this: For, for my part, I tremble to unfold my conjecture. Nevertheleſs I was willing to repeat his own words, to ſhew that there is nothing which we ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of from that abominable Society, which God Almighty ſeems to tolerate to be the Scourge of his Church.</p>
